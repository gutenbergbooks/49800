THE DESULTORY REMARKER.

No. II.

                          Virtue is a good,
    No foe can spoil, and lasting to the grave.
                                        _Glover_.


To that branch of the harmonious family of Literature, of which the
ESSAYIST is a legitimate member, one peculiar immunity has uniformly
been accorded. He has permission, at all times, to commune with his
readers, unrestrained by drawing-room etiquette, and without being
required to appear in full dress. He can, in this respect, plead
immemorial usage, or literary common law, as a privileged personage.
But, as neatness of costume and decorous deportment are never
disregarded, by the well-bred man, in any circumstances; so, the
well-bred writer will not fail in his observance of neatness of style,
and, what is of infinitely more importance, correctness of sentiment.
Familiarity, inordinately indulged, is another name for rudeness.
Motives of the most imperious character, calculated to prompt him to
such a course of conduct, may be found, in contemplating the splendid
union of talent and virtue, by which many of those were distinguished,
who have trodden the same path before him. They were, alternately
engaged, in culling, from its borders, flowers variegated with every
tint of beauty, or in gathering the ripest, most salutary, and most
delightful fruit. Although, on the authority of Bacon and Roscommon,
the author of the "English Dictionary" has defined an ESSAY to be "_an
irregular, indigested piece_," yet there are other eminent scholars,
who, it would appear, did not consider such a definition as perfectly
correct. JOHN LOCKE, one of the greatest men, of whom Great Britain can
boast, and the late Dr. SMITH, of Princeton, have imparted a degree
of dignity to the term, not in exact accordance with the generally
received acceptation of its import. These may, however, be viewed in
the light of exceptions to a general rule. While furnished with the
opportunity, permit me to dwell for a moment, with some emphasis, on
the meritorious ESSAYS of these celebrated writers. The philosophy of
LOCKE has no affinity, whatever, with the infidel philosophy of more
recent times. He was a firm believer in the sublime, and inexpressibly
important, truths of Revelation; and consequently, a serious and devout
Christian. His analysis of mind, and the index he has given by which
to ascertain where its strength may be profitably exerted, and where
the depths of profundity present themselves, which its limited line
cannot fathom, are calculated to teach its true nature and powers. The
perusal of such a work, will necessarily widen the mental horizon of
every intelligent reader, and, at the same time, impart a taste for
that practical mode of inquiry which is characterized by closeness
of research. He advances step by step in his investigations; you are
never solicited to adopt his conclusions, but they are made manifest,
in the broad and clear light of truth. Dr. SMITH, a countryman of our
own, was a man of profound learning, possessing a genius of the highest
order. One reason, for entertaining a high opinion of his ESSAY on the
causes of the difference of complexion, &c. in the human species, shall
be stated. We all have our prejudices; some of which, viewed through
the deceptive medium of education and habit, are probably concealed
from ourselves.--Amongst these prejudices, there are none, perhaps,
stronger or more inveterate, even in Pennsylvania, than those which
exist against the unfortunate and injured African. Oh, my country! thou
art madly provoking the tremendous indignation of Heaven, by a perilous
perseverance in wrong and injustice!

    And hast thou then no law besides thy will,
    No just criterion fix'd to good and ill?

Futurity is wisely concealed from our view; but of this solemn truth
there can be no question,--VICE and OPPRESSION _will not always
go unpunished_. Almost unconscious of it, the unjust bias, above
alluded to, had in some degree taken possession of my mind; but was,
it is hoped, almost entirely removed, by an attentive and thorough
examination of his doctrines. He, as well as LOCKE, contemplates true
philosophy in the elevated character of a hand-maid to Revelation. One
of his leading objects is, to establish, by a course of fair and manly
reasoning, the veracity of the Mosaic account of the creation.

When I sat down at my desk, I had intended to consult a few of the
pages of our early history, for the purpose of finding some profitable
lessons for the instruction of the present generation; but, by
indulging a _desultory_ propensity, the original purpose has almost
been lost sight of. The salutary effect, which results from frequently
ascending to first principles, has been long known and acknowledged.
There is many a prodigal spendthrift among us, who would do well,
in various respects, to imitate the example of his industrious and
unostentatious ancestor, from whom he has inherited the means of
indulging his extravagant desires. He should remember, that the highest
privilege of wealth is to aid the meritorious who stand in need of
assistance; and that industry, properly directed, does, even to the man
whose necessities do not require such exertion, always bring with it an
ample reward. "Health and length of days are in her right hand, and in
her left riches and honour!"

The corner stone of this Commonwealth was laid in immutable justice;
and the hands of her founders were never stained by the blood of an
Indian. Our primitive annals, therefore, solicit, and will endure,
the closest and most rigid scrutiny. The first settlers were plain in
their habits, and simple in their manners. They laboured indefatigably
with their own hands, and their lives were distinguished by pure
morals, and unaffected piety. The blessing of Providence followed
them; and their descendants have become a great people. But how long
will this prosperity last, should their maxims of economy, simplicity,
and temperance, continue to be utterly disregarded? Necessity, it is
believed, is at the present time, teaching some of them with effect.
WILLIAM PENN, whose amiable and great qualities furnish an opulent
subject, on which, if the narrowness of my page did not forbid, I
should delight to dwell, was one of those bright luminaries which, at
distant intervals, have cheered and irradiated a benighted world.

    Thus lovely halcyons dive into the main,
    Then show far off their shining plumes again.

In conclusion, permit me to relate an anecdote of the great lawgiver,
which is traditional, it is true, but, at the same time, direct and
authentic. Being on a visit at the house of one of his friends, who
resided at GWYNEDD, a Welch settlement, twenty miles from Philadelphia,
he remained there during the night. When shown into his chamber, in
which there was a considerable quantity of grain, apologies were made
to him, and regrets expressed, that no better accommodations could be
furnished, on such an occasion. With that urbanity and goodness of
heart, for which he was so remarkable, he immediately put to rest every
anxiety, which had previously existed, by a single observation: "_I do
not wish to see more appropriate furniture in a new settlement; nothing
could give me more pleasure._" It should not be forgotten, that PENN
could number among his _intimate_ friends, many of the English nobility
and gentry; and had stood, with no infrequency, in the presence of
princes, but still his humility and unassuming manners were unimpaired.

THE VILLAGE TEACHER.

                   How little can be known!
    This is the wise man's sigh;--how far we err!
    This is the good man's not unfrequent pang!
                                _Wordsworth_.


There is no faculty of the mind, of which man is more proud, than of
REASON. It is this which most strikingly distinguishes him from the
brute creation, to which he owes his empire over the elements, and by
which he dares ever to explore the councils of the Deity. The triumphs
of reason, however, have chiefly been in the fields of philosophy, and
amidst the stillness of solitude, "in regions mild of calm and serene
air." In the ordinary pursuits of life, her voice is drowned amidst
the clamour of contending passions; and every successive generation
of mankind, has to travel over the same course of inexperience and
presumption, of error and misconduct, of remorse and repentance. The
triumphs of reason in philosophy endure from age to age, and are not
only glorious in themselves, but the means of acquiring new conquests.
Those victories, which she obtains over the passions, are confined
to the lives, and written in the experience, of individuals. The
truths, which it required the utmost capacity of the human intellect
to develope, are now familiar to the apprehension of every school-boy:
but human nature continues to be as prone to evil, as selfish and
untoward, as if the divine Author of our religion had never walked on
earth. There is, in this view of the subject, much that may humble the
most aspiring intellect. It shows, that the greatest genius affords no
exemption from the ordinary weaknesses and vices of our nature, and
that the mere force of reason cannot destroy the propensities which for
ever drag us down to earth.

Even in those pursuits which are purely abstract, the different
degrees of intellect approximate more nearly to each other than we
commonly imagine. There are certain brilliant talents which we are apt
to regard with a kind of superstitious feeling, and which we suppose
to be gifted with an almost intuitive knowledge. Yet, the truth is,
that those qualities which most easily attract the vulgar gaze, are
fallacious and superficial. The highest and most lasting rewards of
fame, have been earned by slow and patient labour; while the more
dazzling career of genius has often terminated in disappointment
and obscurity. He who trusts to the mere force and splendour of his
talents, will find that they cannot sustain his flight, and that the
most brilliant inventions of the human mind fade before the realities
of nature; that there is no real glory in philosophy, separate from
that of truth, and no key which will unlock her treasures, save that
of patient investigation. There can be no discipline, better fitted
to humble the pride and silence the vanity of man, than that of the
inductive philosophy; for it teaches him that the only disposition
of mind, in which he can acquire substantial knowledge, is that of
docility to the voice of experience; and that patience and humility are
far more valuable and efficient in a philosopher, than the brightest
genius. When Newton commenced the researches that conducted him to an
eminence, which no other mortal has attained, it was by careful and
unprejudiced observation. He suffered no previous opinion to mislead
his judgment, no weak ambition to disturb his mind; but watched, with
untiring patience, for the illuminations of truth. It was, probably, to
this careful exclusion of prejudice and vanity, as much as to any other
cause, that he owed his wonderful achievements; for they must have been
attained by regular advances, by steps which the meanest understanding
is capable of following.

If these remarks are correct as regards philosophical, they are more
strikingly so in relation to moral truth. The fabric of philosophy
is the work of ages, and its dimensions are as capacious as those of
nature; but the edifice of moral truth can be perfected in the sphere
of action, and during the life of every individual. Its foundation
is laid by the hand of the Creator in the heart of every intelligent
being, and is spoken of in Scripture, as the rock on which the wise
man built, and under the type of a light which has enlightened every
man, of a word which is nigh us in our heart and in our mouth. This
light may be darkened by superstition, distorted by prejudice, or
buried beneath the cumbrous systems of a false philosophy; but can
never be totally extinguished. He who would follow its illuminations,
and become the votary of truth, must separate himself from these
troubled elements of life. He must listen in quiet seclusion to
her voice, and acquire, by humble and patient watchfulness, that
habitual mastery over his mind, which is the groundwork, and the only
foundation, of permanent excellence; and thus will he gradually come to
know the truth as it is.

He who thinks to hear her still and small voice amidst the agitations
of contending passions, will find himself deaf to its monitions.
In our intercourse with the world, and our chase of its glittering
phantoms, our interests and desires continually mislead us. We follow
their guidance, rather than that of truth; we hurry down the stream
of pleasure and business, and make our reason itself the slave of
our appetites. There is something in the alternations of hope and
fear, in the longings of ambition, and the first flushes of success,
that engrosses and fills the mind. But when the zeal, with which we
followed some object of unworthy ambition, is spent; when the violence
of passion is exhausted, and satiety has succeeded to enjoyment, we
sink down into the bitterness of self-reproach and remorse. We then
perceive how fatally we have wandered from the path of reason, and
determine, while our passions are spent and asleep, to chain them at
her feet. Alas! they will awake, like the tiger from his lair, with the
scent of blood in his nostrils, more furious and more powerful from
every success.

These loose and general remarks may serve to illustrate the admirable
economy of Providence. The truths, which it is important for us to
know, are easily comprehended. Those qualities, by the possession of
which the great end of our being is to be answered, are within the
attainment of every rational creature. By a wonderful law of equality,
the difference which appears to exist between different orders of
intellect, is scarcely sensible in its effects upon the happiness and
virtue of individuals. Brilliant talents, and rare accomplishments,
do but expose their owner to more dangerous and subtle temptations,
and too often furnish the weapon which destroys the peace of their
possessor; while humbler virtues pass along, unconscious of these
self-inflicted tortures. The latter pursue, from instinct and choice,
that path of humble and quiet action, which the former will find, after
all his wanderings, to be the only one that leads to peace, and is
lighted by the pure and unwavering radiance of truth.

SEEDS.

From the Plough-Boy's Cottage.


This morning, as I awoke from my slumbers, these words came before me,
"_Take care what you sow!_" The reflections they have awakened, amidst
the wonderings such a salutation of the morning beam has excited; may
not prove idle or merely speculative.

The husbandman, when he commits his seed to the earth, conscious of
having done all within his power, rests in the goodness of HIM who
rules these lower elements, for the completion of the work. The white
mantle of Nature is thrown over the germs of future sustenance, by the
genial breath of Spring; "the early and the latter rains," and the
vivifying heat of the sun, awaken those germs into beauty, clothe them
with luxuriance, and ripen them for the sickle. But the husbandman well
knows, that unless he be careful to select seed of the proper kind, and
weight and purity, the product, he will reap, will deteriorate in its
nature. However good the soil may be, his granary will receive a value
proportioned only to his attention to the maxim--_Take care what you
sow._

But there are SEEDS, whose value is infinitely greater than wheat, or
rye, or barley. Give me your ears, ye honest hearts of our rich farms,
ye independent men of our beautiful vallies, and let me caution you to
_take care how you sow_!

It is recorded, with great truth, that "books, men and things are lying
constantly in wait to deceive souls, and bring them to perdition:" and
books are here very correctly placed first on the list of deceivers.
They are more dangerous, because less suspected; and the _seeds_,
which are sown, by pernicious volumes, in the minds of the young and
inexperienced, in the silence of solitude, take very deep root, and
bring forth fruits of vice and corruption. O! how the spirit of genuine
sensibility laments the widely spreading evils, which cast desolation
over _fields of beauty!_ Beware! ye noble-minded yeomen, how you admit
into your little libraries, these insidious seducers, these _tares_,
which grow amidst the tender plants which the LORD of the heritage has
deposited in the soil he loves, and committed to your charge. It is
in your power to aid the growth of the germs of goodness and piety,
which may flourish under your fostering care, by the blessing of the
great Husbandman, and make your children the glory of our country!
Aim, therefore, at a judicious selection, that the _seeds_ you sow may
not want either weight or purity; and then "the early and the latter
rain," which descend _from above_, will mature them into strength and
loveliness.

This caution is also peculiarly applicable to those who have the
direction of the numerous village libraries, that have latterly arisen
in our favoured land. On these men, an awful responsibility rests.
They have, in their hands, the future characters of the people, who
may live in their respective neighbourhoods. They have, under their
care, _the destinies of an unborn race_! The _seeds_, which are
now sown in the hearts of the young, will, when they shall become
parents, be transmitted to other soils. What an incalculable magnitude
and importance invest this subject! Let them beware, therefore,
as they shall answer at a high tribunal. "Take care,"--said a
monitor to the celebrated statuary, BACON, as he tapped him on the
shoulder,--"remember, you are working for posterity!"--and the caution
was reciprocated to the divine. _Take care_, says the Plough-Boy, to
the directors of village libraries, _what you sow_!

Many a lovely damsel, whose rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes once
indicated the sweetness and the purity of innocence, has had her heart
tarnished, corrupted, ruined, by the insidious poison of books,--books
read in secret, remote from the vigilant eye of a tender parent or kind
friend. Into the recesses of the solitude of these; yes, even at the
hour when the remainder of the family is reposing in peace, and when
the rays of the midnight lamp are thrown on the idle, the romantic, or
vicious page, let the warning voice of the Plough-Boy enter. May his
accents thunder in their ears, _Take care how you sow_!

The vast increase of _taverns_, in our country and villages, calls
us to beware of _men_, as well as of books. There is a great
difference, my father tells me, between the simplicity of manners,
which characterized the times when he was a boy, and the idleness
and dissipation which have now spread over the country. Then it was
considered a _disgrace_, to a young farmer, to be seen at a tavern,
excepting when absolute necessity called him thither. Now, visit one
of these seductive inns, in an afternoon, and we can see a band of
hardy striplings, smoking their segars, drinking their cans of beer,
or tossing off their glasses of "real Holland," and permitting their
minds to be agitated by the evanescent politics of the day, while
their families are either ignorant of their habits, or mourning over
the tares, which the enemy is sowing in a fruitful field. Alas! even
in his time, the Plough-Boy has witnessed the robust young husbandman,
graced with an athletic form, adorned with vivid health and manly
beauty, and blessed with a lovely wife and innocent prattlers, sink
into an early grave, opened by Infamy and closed by Despair, solely in
consequence,--first, of suffering his mind to be led aside from his
business by the solicitations of idle men, and losing his precious time
at the tavern; and then, of "just taking a social glass," which they
have told him it would be unmanly to refuse.

Beware, my youthful companions, of these _first_, and apparently
insignificant steps in idleness. No man suddenly becomes wicked. The
power of habit is enlisted on the side of virtue, until its barrier be
broken down by repeated _small_ attacks; and he, who in former times
could indignantly exclaim, "Is thy servant a _dog_, that he would do
this thing?" yet committed the very evils at which an exalted spirit
had shuddered with terror. _Take care_, ye young noblemen of Nature!
_how you sow_.

Various other incitements are widely spread through our country,
to lead men to sow seeds of vice and ignominy in their fields. It
becomes not the Plough-Boy to enter too much into detail. The evils
are abroad, and walking their desolating course; and he who can, in
the hour of solitude, yield his mind to the dominion of reflection,
will be at no loss to discover the peculiar inducements to idleness or
dissoluteness, in his own vicinity. To all, therefore, who value the
_seeds of immortal beauty_, let the warning voice of the Plough-Boy of
the valley, reach with effect; and the gentle salutation of the morning
ray, which visited his own spirit, may not have been sent without an
instructive purpose. To all, this lesson is deeply interesting; for
the happiness of the long, long ages of eternity, depends upon it.
"Whatsoever a man shall sow, that will he reap. If ye sow to the flesh,
ye shall reap corruption; but if to the spirit, the life which is
eternal."

  _Downington, January 29, 1820._

"IS IT PEACE, JEHU?"


The evanescent sorrows of infancy have faded from the recollection, the
flowery scenes of childhood are passed, the thraldom of pupilage is
over, the fetters of minority are dissevered, and Youth steps boldly on
the threshold of life, proud of the superiority, and conscious of the
attributes of MAN.

    "The world is all before him where to choose."

Society courts him to the enjoyment of rational and of sensual
pleasure. The anticipation of evil finds no place in his imagination.
All of friendship is faithful, and love pure as attractive. A short
career in the busy round of existence, while it proves the fallacy
of some of his crude conceptions, only affords a confirmation of
others. If trusted friendship discover its instability, or cherished
love its inconstancy, still Fancy promises, in other fountains, the
unadulterated source of happiness. He looks not to the mind to supply
the vacuum they have left. Youth is not the season for reflection. Fame
has not yet animated the daring spirit of enterprise, and the social
circle and the midnight revel display all their attractions. Lost in
the whirl of inebriating delights, Reason maintains but a divided
empire. But let her "still small voice" be heard in the intervals of
passion, and will it not whisper to his heart, _Is it peace?_

The bowl has ceased to exhilarate; this species of excitement is
happily relinquished, and, in the active scenes of business, he finds
a stimulant to exertion and enjoyment. The acquisition of wealth will
enable him to astonish the world with his magnificence; or, if a more
worthy motive prevail, will furnish the means to relieve indigence,
extricate virtuous misfortune from the fetters that chain it to the
earth, and wipe the tear of want from the eye of the widow and the
orphan. Glorious reward for days of toilsome industry. How soon may
he find some more sordid spirit grasping the object that eludes his
pursuit, and the anguish of disappointment displace the glowing visions
of his fancy. While the strife of hopes and fears drive repose from his
pillow, when the howling of the wind reminds him of the instability of
that element on which he has adventured many a _rich argosie_, it would
be mockery for him to ask of Care, _Is it peace?_

Fortune, however, while she laughed to scorn his dreams of princely
splendour, has deigned to crown his days of anxiety with competence,
and Philosophy bids him be content. He chooses a partner of his joys
and sorrows, and sees a hopeful progeny around him. Once more Fancy
spreads the glowing landscape of the future to his eye. Through those
dear ones, whose infantine pleasures now amuse his paternal mind, he
will attain the object of his hopes. His daughters shall wed with the
first families that now tower above him; his sons--

"Visions of glory spare his aking sight;"--

he eagerly anticipates the moment of their matured existence, when he
shall exultingly exclaim, in the fulness of his heart, after the detail
of their unrivalled achievements, I AM THEIR FATHER. A few years roll
away; the fiat of Omniscience is gone forth, and all, but one, of those
that but now cheered his domestic board, are gathered into the garner
of eternity. That one, the first--the last--remains his only comfort.
On that loved one, he, and the beloved partner of his afflictions,
bowed down with sorrow rather than with years, now place their only
hopes. He will support their tottering footsteps; he sooth the sorrows
and smooth the pillow of their waning age. Alas! the haunts of
dissipation receive him; premature infirmities, racking pains, palsied
limbs, hasten him, with rapid and unerring steps, to the grave--and all
beyond it. It were in vain to ask of his agonized bosom,--agonized by
the conviction of his fatal paternal indulgence,--_Is it peace!_

Is not the quiver of affliction exhausted? One shaft is left. That
dear mourner, that has partaken so largely of the cup of his sorrows,
cannot sustain the recollection

"That such things were, and were most dear to her."

Silent and uncomplaining, she bows before the storm. Her ashes rest
with those of her children. Where is now that eager spirit, grasping at
phantoms, and soaring into the regions of uncreated imagination. Hope
is extinguished in his bosom; his soul is black with the very midnight
of despair. Frail man! Didst thou ever ask, _Of whom did I receive
these precious gifts?_ Bow before the throne of Omnipotence; bless that
Power who gave and who took away; pray to him for resignation; and,
when the spirit of vital religion pours its holy influence into thy
heart, thou needest not ask of thyself or the world, _Is it peace?_

_Letters of a Citizen to his Friends in the Country._


No. III.

If the form of government with which we are blessed, is to be durable,
it will depend upon the _virtue and intelligence of the people_.
Ignorance and vice cannot sustain a republican system. It becomes,
therefore, a duty of the highest order, to spread practical learning
over every mind, and cultivate piety in every heart. To do this, the
establishment of good schools, on the plan suggested in my last letter,
is of great importance. But other means are also to be employed.
Parents, guardians, and masters, should discharge their duty toward
those who are entrusted to their care, by judicious advice and good
example, for the conduct of life. The domestic circle ought to be
regarded as a _moral garden_, under the especial care of the head
of every family. Here he may plant good seed, and this he is bound
to protect from all pernicious weeds. Let him therefore frequently
examine the premises; he cannot be too assiduous, and vigilant. In
this particular department, more is to be accomplished, than many are
disposed to admit. And if ever our condition as a people is improved,
in the degree to which it is susceptible, it will owe much to judicious
_family discipline_. In the city, as well as in the country, we have
been too relax in the performance of these manifest obligations.
Private happiness and the public welfare are intimately connected with
the minute government, and careful training, of the minds of youth.

Among other auxiliaries, I would take the liberty to recommend the
establishment of libraries, to be composed of useful books. These might
be located in the school-houses of each neighbourhood, and the teacher
should be appointed to the care of the establishment. In the country,
it is customary to assemble but once, in the day assigned, for social
worship; in the afternoon of that day, the library might be opened
for the delivery and reception of books. How much better would it be,
to witness the people passing, in an orderly manner, to, and from
the library of the vicinage, than assembling at taverns, or employed
in idle and pernicious sports, on the evening of a day, set apart by
Christian professors, for the worship, which is publicly due _to the
Sovereign of the world_!

You may suppose, fellow citizens, that these suggestions are the
offspring of a visionary brain; but the period is coming, with no tardy
step, when sound morals and undefiled religion will be found to be the
best estate. Men and governments prosper solely in proportion as they
are regulated by principles which GOD approves. It is idle, in the last
degree, to expect prosperity from any other source. All history, sacred
and civil, teaches but one lesson; VICE AND IGNORANCE CONDUCT NATIONS
TO THE TOMB!

This epistle is shorter than I had designed it to be; various
avocations have claimed my attention. I have only to solicit your
attention to the subjects submitted in it to your notice, and to assure
you of my good will.

                                                                  CIVIS.




Treatise on Agriculture.

SECT. II.

Of the actual state of Agriculture in Europe.


8. _Holland_, though essentially commercial has, from causes rarely
occurring, become also highly agricultural. To the descendants of
Dutchmen, the following description of her industry, in this respect,
cannot but be acceptable. It is from the pen of an excellent judge and
faithful narrator.[1]

[1] M. Yoarst, professor of agriculture at Elfort. See his introductory
address to his class, in 1806.

"Their rotation of crops, always begins with the culture either of some
leguminous plant or profitable root, and generally with the potato, as
the best preparative of the ground. Whatever may be the grain which
follows, whether wheat, rye, &c. &c. it is generally sown with _red
clover_; and where it is not, the stubble is ploughed in immediately
after harvest, and a crop of turnips taken and either consumed on
the ground or housed for the winter. A single department (that of
Zealand) obtains by the culture of madder alone, an annual profit
of six millions of florins; while that of Brabant boasts its twenty
thousand bee-hives; in a word, this commendable nation, upon an extent
of surface not exceeding seventeen hundred square leagues, (the greater
part of which has been redeemed from the ocean) counts two hundred and
forty-three thousand horses, seven hundred and sixty thousand horn
cattle, about a million of sheep, from ten to twelve thousand goats,
four hundred and eighty-nine thousand hogs, and about three millions of
poultry, of every species. Their stock of manure is necessarily great,
and is both well understood and well managed."

9. The same causes, physical and moral, operate against the existence
of a productive agriculture in _Denmark_ and _Sweden_--severity of
climate, poverty of soil, and vassalage of tenants.[2]--Their resources
are also alike, and exist principally in manufactures and commerce, and
in mines, forests and fisheries. The former boasts fine pasturage and
cattle, in Holstein.

[2] To give to despotism the air of freedom, the _serfs of the crown_
were liberated at the revolution--but the example was neither approved
nor followed.

10. Under the common name of Germany, we include Prussia, Saxony,
Austria, Wurtemburg, and Bavaria, and shall say a few words of each,
calculated to give a general idea of their husbandry. It was not to be
expected that the great Frederick of _Prussia_ (so devoted to national
glory and strength) would disregard the interest of agriculture;
and the less so, as in theory he considered it "_Les mamelles de
l'elat_." We accordingly find him employed in draining marshes of
great extent,[3] in filling them with industrious colonists, and in
converting barren sands into fertile fields, by placing his capital in
the midst of them. But amongst these good works, he forgot that the
_hands of the labourer, to be efficient, must be free_; he found the
peasants slaves, and left them such.

[3] In the _Dollart_ what was lost by the sea was regained, and the
marshes on the _Netz_ and the _Warth_ at _Friedburg_ and in _Pomerania_
were drained, and the country rendered habitable.

The _Saxon_ peasant, on the other hand is _free_ and protected by the
law; he holds his farm on lease, which he sells or transmits to his
children at will: and _this_ is the principal cause of the flourishing
state of Saxon agriculture. In Lusatia, a different legislation
produces different effects; but for some years past, the government and
great proprietors have concurred in changing the _vassalage_ of the
peasants into a _mild_ and _salutary dependence_. Saxony is remarkable
for its grain products, and Lusatia for its stock--the latter counts
four hundred thousand head of sheep of the merino race.

Geographers give to _Austria_ and her dependencies 1965 leagues in
circumference. In a surface like this, there is necessarily a great
variety, as well of climate as of soil; but in general, both are
favourable to agriculture. "In the districts of the Inn, of Lower
Stira, of Istria, and of Carniola, the land is of good quality, well
cultivated and very productive. In the last, they have two crops in
the year; sowing buck-wheat on wheat or rye stubble, and millet on
that of hemp and flax.--They every where cultivate Indian corn, and in
Styria (as in Virginia) it forms the ordinary bread of the country."
In Bohemia, Moravia, and Galitia,[4] the soil is uncommonly rich, and
under proper management would be very productive. Austrian Silesia
is less fitted for the production of grain, but excels in forage and
cattle. Hungary, Transylvania and Croatia, abound in every species
of agricultural produce. Their flocks and pasturage are not inferior
to those of the Ukraine; and wheat, buck-wheat, Indian corn, millet,
rice, hemp, flax and tobacco, yield immense harvests to very small
degrees of labour. Yet is agriculture far from being in a flourishing
condition!--Writers on political economy ascribe this fact principally
to two causes--

[4] Geographic Math.

1st. The degradation and oppression of the labouring part of the
community; and

2d. The want of convenient commercial outlets for the produce of the
soil.

We shall find in Hungary a striking illustration of the correctness of
this opinion. "The _Populus Hungaricus_," is divided into four estates,
the magnates, the nobles, and the clergy, who possess all the lands,
and the "_misera contribuens plebs_," who (besides tithes, rents and
corvees) pay all the taxes. This wretched populace is composed of the
burghers and the peasantry, of which there are three kinds--_slaves for
life, temporary slaves_, and a third sort called _liberæ emigrationis_,
who, as their name indicates, have loco motive powers and rights.
Of the condition of this people, since the year 1764, (and before
that period it was much worse) we may form an idea from the edict of
Maria Theresa, called the _urbarium_, or law of contracts between
landlord and tenant, by which it is declared, that corporal punishment
(inflicted by the master for insolent words or conduct) shall not
exceed twenty-four strokes with a cane for a man, and the same number
with a switch for a woman. Nor is the _commercial_ condition of this
people better than the _civil_; they are not only obliged to take from
Austria many things which they could have had in other places of a
better quality and at a lower price, but they are also compelled to
carry to Vienna the products of their own soil and labour, where their
sale is embarrassed and their value lessened by heavy and oppressive
taxes. The same remark applies to Galitia, whose natural outlet is the
Vistula, or the Nieper; but of these she is not permitted to avail
herself, and, like her sister kingdoms, is compelled to seek the
markets furnished by the Danube and Trieste. "The consequences are
obvious--the tenant works only to satisfy hunger, and the landlord is
satisfied with little more than '_victum et vestitum_.'"[5]

The amount of lands annually cultivated in _Bavaria_, is one million
one hundred and sixty-five thousand acres, which produce about six
millions of bushels of grain, of which two millions are surplus.
The Palatinate, (one of the dependencies of Bavaria) is also very
productive. The route between Heidelberg and D'Armstadt, called the
_Bergstrass_, traverses one of the finest districts of Germany, and
perhaps of Europe; where are seen extensive vineyards, vast meadows
and fertile fields, producing wheat, barley, tobacco, madder, rhubarb,
turnips, &c. &c. In the year 1799, all the electorial possessions
within the circle of Bavaria, contained 199,000 horses, 160,000 oxen,
465,000 cows, 961,000 sheep, 320,000 hogs, and 378,000 goats. Yet are
the Bavarians, compared with the inhabitants of the north of Germany,
half a century in the rear. The people are, extremely ignorant and
fantastical: like the people of Rome and Lisbon, they sacrifice
much time to processions and fetes, and like them also are slaves of
the vilest appetites. Debauchery is no where more flagrant than in
Munich.[6]

with England--the comparison is in favour of the former.

_Wurtemburg_ is ranked among the most fertile and well cultivated
countries of Germany. The mountainous parts produce potatoes, oats,
hemp and flax; the less hilly abound in wheat, spelts, rye, buck-wheat,
Indian corn and barley; and in the vallies we find tobacco, madder and
vineyards, in which the grapes of France, Cyprus, and Persia succeed
perfectly. Apples, pears, &c. are of common product and excellent
quality.[7]

[7] Idem.

11. It has been justly remarked, that to know the state of husbandry in
any country, you have but to examine the _instruments_ employed, the
_succession_ of _crops_, and the _condition_ of _labourers_.--Tried
by these tests, the agriculture of _Russia_ will be found to be in
a state of great degradation.--The plough (called _soka_) which
is commonly used, is very light, of simple construction, and but
calculated to enter the ground _one inch and a half_; the _harrow_
consists of one or more young pine trees (whose branches are cut off
about eight inches from the stem) steeped in water to add to their
weight, and tied together. With such miserable instruments, each drawn
by a single horse, the farmer scratches the ground, and without always
covering the seed, which is no doubt the reason that in dry seasons
their harvests are very bad.[8] In the best soil their _succession_ of
_crops_ is of _eight years_--two in barley, two in oats, two in winter
rye, and two in spring rye. Lands of less fertility are sown _two_
years out of _three_, and mountainous tracts one year in three, when
they are abandoned to weeds, until rest shall have reinstated them.
"To manure them would, in the opinion of a Russian peasant, make them
poorer;[9] and therefore he suffers his dunghill to accumulate into
a nuisance, while he goes on to clear and exhaust new fields." "The
grains raised are rye, spelts, barley, millet and oats, which, from
want of sufficient roads and markets, are often low priced; as are
horned cattle and horses: an ox selling for a ruble and a half, a cow
for one ruble, and a horse for three rubles."[10] To this wretchedness
we must add, (what perhaps occasions much of it) that throughout the
_civilized_ part of Russia, the labours of agriculture are performed by
_slaves_ confounded with the soil, and bought and sold with it. In a
great portion of the northern section of this vast empire, agriculture
is unknown; and the chase, the fisheries, cattle and rein-deer, furnish
the only means of subsistence.

Mr. Nicholson's Prize Essay.

_On a Rotation of Crops, and the most profitable mode of collecting,
preserving and applying Manures._

(Communicated to the Albany County Agricultural Society.)

[CONCLUDED.]


Of manures which may be termed fossils we will mention the various
kinds of calcareous substances, the stony matter called pyrites, coal,
salt, peaty substances, silicious and aluminous earths. Limestone,
gypsum, chalk and marle, are the calcareous substances we shall notice,
and each in their order.

Limestone, (carbonate of lime,) has always more or less aluminous
or silicious earth in its composition. Frequently also it contains
magnesia. Limestone of this latter description, when calcined, makes
what the English farmers call _hot_ lime, which is more powerful in
its effects, and therefore less of it should be applied at once to the
soil. That without any mixture of magnesia is considered more durable
in its operation, but less powerful. Magnesian limestone is known by
its effervescing but little when plunged in nitric or other acid, while
limestone that is not magnesian, when thus immersed produces a strong
effervescence. The magnesian, also, when immersed in diluted nitric
acid, or aqua fortis, renders the liquid of a milky appearance. It is
usually of a brownish or pale yellow colour. Being more caustic when
calcined, than common limestone, it is more efficacious in decomposing
peaty earths, and is best adapted for soils which have too much either
of peaty or vegetable matter in them.----Where lands have been injured
by too plentiful an application of this lime, peaty earth should be
applied to them to correct the evil.

The trials of lime in this country have been quite limited, and
confined mostly to the middle states, particularly Pennsylvania. It
has usually been applied there at the rate of about forty bushels
to the acre; but whether the lime used there is magnesian, we have
never understood. Lime may be applied as a top dressing or mixed with
the soil. Its application has been found most successful when the
first succeeding crop was Indian corn; afterwards wheat is grown to
advantage. Instances are mentioned in the memoirs of the agricultural
society of Philadelphia, where gypsum had no effect on worn out lands
till they were first manured with lime.

British writers say that lime may be applied with equal advantage
either when newly slaked or afterwards, that its effects are not
always the same particularly where soils are different, but that
usually it is a very durable manure. A much larger quantity is,
however, applied in Great Britain than has been usual here; but perhaps
the coolness of the summers there renders more requisite. We pretend
to advise to no particular rules in the application of lime in this
country, farther than that about forty bushels to the acre be first
tried; but less for sandy soils, and perhaps more for those which are
stiff clays would be advisable. In clays of this description, lime is
particularly useful in destroying the adhesive quality of such soils,
and thereby rendering them a more friable loam. Such has been its
effects on the clay lands which abound so much in England. Where the
lime is magnesian, let trials be made of about twenty bushels to the
acre.

That country abounds much in the calcareous matter denominated chalk,
which is also converted into lime by calcination, and used as a manure.
It forms a weaker sort of lime. As this substance, however, is hardly
to be found in this country, it will be unnecessary further to speak of
this manure.

Gypsum, (sulphate of lime) is a most powerful stimulant to the growth
of many crops in all dry soils in this country, but with the following
exceptions: it has no sensible effect on lands newly cleared, on those
in the vicinity of the ocean, nor on those which have been completely
exhausted by severe cropping. In soils of this latter description, some
pabulous matter must be given them for the gypsum to digest or act
upon; and this may be a previous manuring with lime, marl, bog-earth,
barn dung, or perhaps any substance that is calculated to improve the
condition of the soil. It should also be observed that the application
of gypsum frequently fails entirely of producing its effects if
followed by uncommon drought, or unusually wet weather. It is generally
most powerful when applied to growths of leguminous plants, to those
extending in vines, such as the various species of the gourd tribe, the
strawberry, &c. and to several sorts of the green crops, particularly
potatoes, clover-grasses, lucern, &c. On fibrous rooted grasses, and
those grain plants most nearly related to them, such as wheat, rye,
oats, barley, &c. it has no sensible effect when applied as a top
dressing to the growing plants. On Buckwheat it is very powerful, and
for Indian corn it is also valuable. Judge Peters, (of Penn.) whose
experience of its uses has been long and extensive, says that although
he has found this manure of little use to many sorts of plants, when
applied to them as a top dressing, yet he has invariably found that all
plants derive benefit from their seeds being rolled in gypsum, after
being soaked in some liquid, before sowing or planting. As a manure,
however, for wheat or grain crops of similar kinds, immense benefit
may be derived from it by applying it to the sward, as a top dressing,
a suitable length of time before the ground is broken up. In this way
two bushels of gypsum may be made to give an additional increase of
eight or ten bushels of wheat to the acre. Take, for instance, land
which in its natural state, and with the usual culture, will only yield
ten bushels of wheat to the acre; in the fall or early in the spring,
give it a top dressing of two bushels of gypsum to the acre; by the
middle of June following, the land will exhibit a fresh green sward,
principally of white clover; and when land is thus clothed in verdure,
it is a sure indication of a great addition to its fertility, and that
a good crop may then be expected. When, therefore, the green sward is
thus formed, turn it under, and then, with the usual culture, twenty
bushels of wheat to the acre may be expected, where only ten would
have been had without this previous enriching of the ground by the
application of gypsum. Yet the same quantity of this manure, applied as
a top dressing to the growing crop of wheat, would have had no sensible
effect. It should therefore be understood, that for all growths which
derive little or no benefit from gypsum, when applied as a top dressing
to the growing plants, the ground should be previously enriched by
applying this manure to the sward, a suitable length of time before it
is to be broken up, which length of time will usually be from two to
three months. At all events as soon as the sward fully exhibits the
effects of the gypsum it may then be turned under. Wherever a sward
is to be turned under, this practice should be invariably pursued in
order that the ground be rendered more fruitful for the crop that is to
follow.

In this country gypsum is a great source of wealth, wherever soils are
sensible to its effects. It has tended much to equalize the value of
lands, by imparting an artificial fertility to those naturally more
sterile, and that at a small expense.--But gypsum alone is by no means
a sufficient source of dependence as a manure for keeping lands in the
improved condition that is necessary for raising the best crops, and
of course deriving the greatest profits. The farmer should attend also
to making the most of such other manures as come conveniently within
his reach. We are, however, no advocate for obtaining manures at any
price; they may cost too much; but almost every farmer whose lands
are of suitable quality, and who stocks them with as many cattle as
he can keep in good order, and then makes the best use of the manure
they afford, may usually, with this supply, and with the judicious
use of gypsum, added to good culture, keep his lands in an improving
condition.

But some soils are so constituted as to be of diminished value without
a suitable mixture of other earths than those of which they are
composed, and in such case are permanently benefited by such additions
of earthy substances. If lands, for instance, are too sandy, or
gravelly, the addition of clay to them, or what is better, of upland
marle, will permanently improve the soil; and where these earths can
be found within reasonable distance it will usually be labour well
expended in making such applications. We will state a case in point.
In the rear of the city of Albany lies an immense body of calcarious
earth, which may properly be called a schistic marle. It is commonly
called blue clay. This, when mixed with a due proportion of sand, forms
a very fertile and durable soil. Farther west of the city lie large
tracts of sandy lands, which require suitable proportions of this marle
to render them fit for good culture, and with such additions much of
them would be found very valuable. Where they lie sufficiently level,
and are not too sandy, it will probably be found that from half a ton
to a ton for every rod square would be sufficient to render them very
fertile, and fitted for the most profitable rotations of crops.

This sort of marle, which may be found in various parts of the country,
and very frequently under tracts of sandy lands, is a very valuable and
permanent manure in all dry soils which are deficient of calcarious
matter, and have not already too great a proportion of clay in their
composition. This manure should be laid on the land as a top dressing,
in order that it may be completely pulverized before it is mixed with
the soil.

Upland marle is sometimes found of silicious texture, in which case
it is good for stiff soils, as well as for others. It is also found
of different colours, when combined with argillaceous matter, and of
different qualities; that containing most lime or calcarious matter
being always the best. Marles of this description are often very
valuable in forming a principal ingredient in composts, of which we
shall presently speak, and the same may be observed of the superior
sorts of this manure found in bog swamps, of which something shall now
be said.

This sort of marle is found, at greater or less depths, beneath the
surface of many bog swamps, and is of a whitish, a greyish, or a
brownish colour. The whitish is the most powerful, having most lime
in its composition; the greyish is next in quality. The super stratum
is either a bog earth, to wit, vegetable matter totally decomposed;
or it is a peaty substance, or vegetable matter in a partial state of
decomposition. The bog earth is good manure of itself, and may be used
separately, or mixed with the marle; the peaty substance must undergo
a further decomposition before it is rendered valuable as a manure, it
being then rendered similar to bog earth. These manures when applied
to growing crops are somewhat similar in their effects to those of
gypsum. They are valuable as top dressings, or for mixing with the
soil. Their effects are very powerful on Indian corn, and they are more
or less valuable when applied to almost every sort of upland crop,
with the exception of wheat, rye, barley, &c. For these they are to be
applied to the sward, a suitable time before breaking it up, as has
been mentioned in regard to gypsum. It should, however, be observed,
that neither decomposed peat, nor bog earth, should be applied to soils
which already contain too great a proportion of decomposed vegetable
matter.

The condition of clay soils is also permanently improved by mixing
a due proportion of sand in them. The most durable and perfect soil
is chiefly composed of certain proportions of sand, clay, lime, and
vegetable matter in a state of decomposition, and, whenever any soil
is destitute of a due proportion of any of these, the addition of such
earthy substance can never fail to serve as a manure.

The stony earth called Pyrites, when pulverised by the aid of a proper
degree of calcination, is much used; and highly esteemed in Flanders
as a top dressing for grass lands, as is mentioned in a communication
of the late Chancellor Livingston to the Society for the promotion of
the useful arts in this state. We will refer the reader to the 2d vol.
published by that Society for the manner of preparing this manure, and
the quantity to be used, &c.

Of coal, we shall merely state that, from the results of experiments
made by the late Mr. Muhlenburg, (of Penn.) about 40 bushels to the
acre of this substance, pulverised in the manner of gypsum, was found a
good manure, when applied as a top dressing.

Common salt, pulverised, and applied as a top dressing, at the rate of
from two to four bushels to the acre, has, in many instances, powerful
effects as a manure. Sea-water is peculiarly adapted for this purpose.
Mr. Deane, in his Farmer's Dictionary, mentions an instance where
a crop of potatoes, and another of flax, were greatly increased in
product by an application of sea-water to them while growing. About a
pint of the water was applied to each hill of potatoes, and for the
flax crop the water was sprinkled over the ground.

Some trials have been made in this country of using burnt clay as a
manure, and its use is recommended, particularly for all dry arable
lands, not inclining to clay. The first step in preparation for burning
clay, is to have a considerable quantity of this earth dug up in spits,
and laid to dry in the sun: when pretty well dried you prepare for
burning by raising a little pile of dry wood in the shape of a pyramid,
say 4 or 5 feet high;--round this you build up the dried spits of clay,
leaving a hole at the bottom, for the entrance of the air, and another
at the top for it to pass off. Such, at least, was the method formerly
practised in Great Britain, but the modern improvement of retaining the
smoke within the mass, agreeably to the plan spoken of by Mr. Cobbett,
for burning earth, ought also to be pursued in burning clay. After the
fire has been set to the wood you continue digging up fresh clay and
piling it around and over the heap, as fast as the fire penetrates
the mass, taking care, however, not to pile on so much at once as to
extinguish the fire. If there be danger of its becoming extinguished,
it may be advisable to make one or more holes in the sides of the
heap by running a hole into it. The fresh earth is to be added during
pleasure or until a sufficient quantity is burned. After the heap has
cooled it is fit for use, either by mixing with the soil as directed by
Mr. Cobbett, for applying burnt earth, of which we will next speak.

By a late improvement, earths, other than those of clay, are
successfully converted into good manure, by the process of burning. It
is effected by retaining the smoke within the mass of earth while in a
state of ignition. Mr. Cobbett says he has tried this manure for the
ruta-baga crop, and found it as efficacious as barn dung. His manner
of preparing it, and which we believe would also be the best method of
preparing burnt clay, is as follows:

"I make a circle," says Mr. C. "or an oblong square. I cut sods and
build a wall all round three feet thick, and four feet high. I then
light a fire in the middle with straw, dry sticks, boughs, or such like
matter. I go on making this fire larger and larger, till it extend over
the whole bottom of the pit or kiln. I put on roots of trees or any
rubbish wood, till there be a good thickness of strong coals. I then
put on the _driest_ of the clods that I have ploughed up round about,
so as to cover all the fire over. The earth thus put in will burn. You
will see the smoke coming out at little places here and there. Put
more clods wherever the smoke appears. Keep on thus for a day or two.
By this time a great mass of fire will be in the inside. And now you
may dig out the clay, or earth, any where round the kiln, and fling it
on without ceremony, always taking care to _keep in the smoke_; for,
if you suffer that to continue coming out at any one place, a hole
will soon be made; the main force of the fire will draw to that hole;
a blaze like that of a volcano, will come out, and the fire will be
extinguished.

"A very good way is to put your finger into the top of the heap
here and there; and if you find the fire _very near_, throw on more
earth.--Not _too much at a time_, for that weighs too heavily on the
fire, and keeps it back; and, at _first_ will put it partially out. You
keep on thus augmenting the kiln, till you get to the top of the walls,
and then you may, if you like, raise the walls and still go on. No rain
will affect the fire, when once it is become strong.

"The principle is to _keep out air_, whether at the top or the sides,
and this you are sure to do, if you _keep in the smoke_. I burnt, this
last summer, about thirty wagon loads in one round kiln, and never saw
the smoke at all after the first four days. I put in my finger to try
whether the fire was near the top; and when I found it approaching, I
put on more earth. Never was a kiln more completely burnt.

"Now, this may be done on the skirt of any wood where the matters are
all at hand. This mode is far preferable to the _above ground_ burning
in _heaps_. Because in the next place, the _smoke escapes there_,
which is the finest part of the burnt matter. _Soot_, we know well, is
more powerful than ashes, and, soot is composed of the _grossest parts
of the smoke_. That which flies out of the chimney is the best part of
all.

"In case of a want of wood wherewith to begin the fire, the fire may be
lighted precisely as in the case of _paring and burning_. If the kiln
be large, the oblong square is the best figure.--About _ten feet wide_,
because then a man can fling the earth easily over every part. The mode
they pursue in England when there is no _wood_, is to make a sort of
building in the kiln with turfs and leave air holes at the corners of
the walls, till the fire be well begun. But this is tedious work; and
is in this country wholly unnecessary. Care must, however, be taken,
that the fire be well lighted. The matter put in _at first_ should be
such as is of the lightest description; so that a body of earth on fire
may be obtained, before it be too heavily loaded.

"The burning being completed, having got the quantity you want, let the
kiln remain. The fire will continue to work, until all is ashes. If you
want _use_ the ashes sooner, open the kiln. They will be cold enough to
remove in a week."

A practice has long prevailed in Europe of paring and burning soils for
the purpose of improving their texture and increasing their fertility.
On clay lands, and such as contain too much vegetable matter, we
conceive the process might be advisable if not too expensive. Its
effect on clays is to destroy the adhesive quality of the soil, as the
earth burned becomes rather of a silicious texture; and at the same
time the surface is much enriched by the operation. In the other case
it is calculated to reduce the redundancy of vegetable matter, as well
as to enrich the soil. The operation is performed in the following
manner:

When the ground is in a good sward of grass let it be carefully turned
over with the plough, the irons of which should be well sharpened. Let
the plough run about three inches deep.--Then cross plough with a very
sharp coulter, and the sward will all be cut into squares of about 10
or 12 inches. You then proceed to set these square chunks up edgeways,
by leaning two together, in which situation they will soon dry.--When
well dried build a part of them tip in the form of little ovens, and
let this be done at the distance of about every 18 feet each way. These
are all to have a little opening or door, at a common windward side,
for the air to enter, and another opening above for the smoke to pass
off. On some dry day when the wind is fair for blowing into the holes
below place some straw or other dry rubbish into the holes and set fire
to it. As soon as the fires have got fully going in each of the heaps,
let the holes in the tops be stopped up, for the purpose of retaining
the smoke, and keep gradually building up the heaps as the fire
penetrates them, until all the chunks of earth are piled up round them;
and when the heaps have fully burned and sufficiently cooled, they are
to be evenly spread over the ground, and ploughed in.

In some parts of Great Britain it has been the practice to burn peat
earth, in a manner very similar to that before described for burning
clay, and the ashes thus obtained from the mass were used for top
dressings; but we believe this practice has mostly given way to that
of rotting or decomposing peat in compost, the method of which is as
follows: you form the compost heap of about one half of peat, a fourth
of lime, and a fourth of barn dung, and these substances are to be
separately laid along in a manner most convenient to be afterwards
thrown into the compost heap in their proper proportions. You commence
at one end with spreading a layer of peat on the ground, say, ten
feet square and four inches in depth; then a layer of lime on this
and another of barn dung, each two inches thick; then another layer
of peat, as before, and then the lime and barn dung, as before, until
in this way the heap is raised about four feet high, and let the last
layer be of peat: then commence another ten feet square along side of
this, and raise it as before, till you raise it to the same height;
then with another ten feet square, at the end of this mass, and so on,
till the heap is completed. After the heap has stood a while, it will
heat, and when the heat begins to subside, you commence again at one
end of the heap and cut the whole down to the bottom, with the spade,
and form a new heap, throwing the exterior parts of the heap, thus
cut down, into the middle of the other. A second heating of the mass
will then commence, and when that subsides, the peat will be found
sufficiently decomposed, and the whole an excellent mass of manure.

In this country peaty substances are usually to be found in morasses;
as the superstratum of marle, as before-mentioned; as the principal
ingredient of the salt marshes contiguous to the ocean, and as the
superstratum of tracts of cold lands which are covered with growths of
evergreen trees.

In making composts with upland marle, before-mentioned, the proportions
of the marle, with that of the lime and dung, may be similar to those
just mentioned for the peat composts, or perhaps the marle may be in
greater proportion. The layers of each may be as before described, but
the heap only raised to such height that it may be cleft down to the
bottom with the plough, then thrown together in a ridge again with this
implement; and let these operations be repeated, at intervals, till the
whole becomes well mixed, pulverised, and in a state of fermentation,
when it is fit for use, and should be immediately applied to the soil
in the manner before-mentioned.

The use of wood ashes as a manure, is well known. It is good for
almost all crops, and is to be used as a top dressing. It is much more
efficacious as a manure in some parts of the country than others,
particularly on Long Island. It is most valuable on light dry soils,
particularly those which are sandy. Soot, as a top dressing, is much
more valuable than ashes, and is proper for almost all arable lands. It
is most efficacious when well pulverised before its application.

The dung of fowls of every sort has much calcareous matter in it, and
is very efficacious, applied as top dressings. Malt dust is good in the
same way--40 bushels of it is a proper allowance to the acre.

_Night shade_ should be mixed with earth, say, two thirds of the latter
to one of the former, and in the course of a few months it forms an
excellent manure. In most European cities this excrement is carefully
collected, for manure, while in this country its use has been neglected.

Many liquids are furnished from every domicile, and particularly the
kitchen, which, mixed with earths, and other substances, would form
valuable masses of manure. The liquids to which we principally refer,
are the soap-suds, dish-water, brine of meat, urine, &c.; these should
all be preserved, by being absorbed in rich earthy substances, together
with the contents of the hog-sty; and in this way a large heap of good
manure may be made that is commonly lost for want of attention in
saving these ingredients.




FROM THE RECORD.

_Agricultural Education._


No cause has more retarded the progress of education in the
agricultural part of the community than a mistaken opinion, in regard
to the use that can be made of it.--That the advantages of learning,
in every state of society, should not be appreciated by the grossly
ignorant, is not to be wondered at; but that men well informed on many
subjects, should fall into the vulgar error of denying the advantages
arising from extensive knowledge is really surprising.

We hear it frequently observed by farmers, who have sons to educate,
that they intend such a one to follow his own occupation; and it will
be necessary that he should be taught to read, write, and cypher
to the "Rule of Three." Now it is believed with these _extensive_
acquirements, a farmer will be able to keep his accounts tolerably
decent; to estimate the amount of any number of bushels of grain, at a
given sum per bushel: but I shall forbear to mention all the advantages
which this kind of knowledge may confer. The intelligent farmer well
knows it has a boundary, and a very limited one too. To endeavour
by force of reason to induce this class of farmers to abandon their
errors, would be time spent to little purpose; their minds are not
recipient for truths which lie beyond the narrow boundary of their
learning.

It is to the enlightened and public spirited yeomanry of our
country, that we are to look for a change in the education of our
youth.--Change, did I say? Rather an entire new system of education.
I ask this class of farmers if they have any such a thing as an
agricultural education among them. I mean an elementary, a systematic
one: we train our youth (at school) for the counting-house, and not
for the farm. We teach them the mysteries of the _cent per cent_; all
the dark intricacies of annuities, all the crooks and turns, and all
the advantages of barter, discount and fellowship. While of Natural
Philosophy, Chemistry, Botany, Mineralogy, Geology and other sciences,
directly or indirectly connected with agriculture, they remain as
ignorant as if they never were to apply any of the principles to
practice. Can it then be wondered that agriculture has advanced so
little? Ought we not rather to wonder that it has advanced so much as
it has, since so little pains are taken to qualify our youth to make
improvement in it? As an art it is perhaps more capable of improvement
than any other, because the sciences on which it is founded, are more
numerous and more extensive in their nature.

By whom are improvements to be made? by men whose knowledge of the art
has never deviated from the beaten track which their forefathers had
trodden, and this knowledge was bequeathed to them with this condition,
"thus far shalt thou go and no farther?" Common sense answers in
the negative. Do we expect important improvements in our present
systems of agriculture, from men who have been educated merchants
or schoolmasters? Their minds cannot be sufficiently interested in
such subjects to pursue them either with ardour or with profit. They
have never acquired a taste for those studies which would render the
different operations of farming a series of philosophical experiments.

In too many instances, farmers' sons, who have been educated as
above described, lose all relish for their occupation, and engage in
some mercantile business. In many instances they contrive to worry
through life without deserting their calling, though they receive
little pleasure from any part of it, except counting the money which
it yields. The source from which we have received our new systems of
farming lay in quite a different quarter. Inhabitants of cities, or men
who have been educated for some learned profession, are our teachers
in the rules of husbandry. We will suppose these men to be well
versed in the sciences above alluded to. But have they ever learned
their application to agriculture? If not, as well might they adduce
principles on that subject, as a person to attempt solving an abstruse
problem in surveying, who has only learned the elements of geometry.
When I spoke of an _agricultural education_, I did not confine my
views to the sciences above specified. _Practice_ is an indispensable
part of this education. The chemist may sit in his laboratory and
give us a system of agriculture, stolen from European treatises, and
may occasionally sprinkle it with some hard words of his own; but
it is only the _practical and scientific farmer_ that can draw from
this heterogenous mass, all that is valuable and applicable to his
own purpose, and nothing more. The principles he receives from books
must be tested by experiment. To make important deductions from these
experiments, unwearied patience must be exercised, in order to sift
real conclusions from those which are only plausible. Let him not sit
down supinely, after having ascertained a rule, for general rules in
this science as in most others have their exceptions, and an accurate
knowledge of these exceptions will require much time for discernment,
and investigation. If agriculture, then, is an art of calling forth all
the faculties of the mind, why is it not taught like other arts by a
regular and systematic education?

FROM THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCER.

_On the Grape Vine, with its wines, brandies, salt, and dried fruits._

No. II.


The object of these papers is to excite to objects of agriculture,
manufacture, commerce, and consumption of the utmost importance to
the prosperity of our country. The forms and niceties of literary
composition will yield their claim to attention to the more solid
substance of the pertinent information and suggestions.

In the course of the consideration of this subject, several letters
from living friends to our prosperity have been brought together. The
remainder of this paper will be appropriated to the publication of one
of those letters, of very recent date, from a native of the United
States, of the best opportunities, in _Bordeaux_, the emporium of that
part of the kingdom of France which gives to us the largest quantities
of the most esteemed wines and brandies which enter into our regular
consumption. It here follows, in its own clear and instructive terms.

"I have been favoured by your letter of the 24th. _Chaptal_, sur la
Culture de Vine, _l'Abbe Rozier's_ memoire sur le mellieure maniere
de faire et gouverner les Vins, and _Jullien's_ Topographie de tout
les Vignobles, are the authors the most in repute in France on the
vine and on wine. The first and last can be had in Philadelphia; and
if _Rozier's_ memoir is not to be found, as it is an old book, you
can doubtless find at your French book stores, his Dictionary of
Agriculture, 5 vols. in 4to. which, under the head of _Vine_, will give
you all the information you desire.

"The district which produces the best wine, about Bordeaux, is _Medoc_.
That county is divided into upper and lower _Medoc_, lying between the
Gironde and Garonne and the Bay of Biscay. It is much such a country,
as to hill and dale, or general surface, as that between Philadelphia
and Trenton, of a sandy, sandy-loam, and gravelly soil, with some
few exceptions of small patches. About seven leagues from north to
south, and three from east to west, of this district, is occupied with
vineyards, which produce the best wine, whose expositions are from
east to south.

"In this district, Lafitte, Chateau Margaux, Latour, Leoville, La Rose,
Braune Mouton, and St. Julien, with various other qualities of Claret,
are produced, which bring from $60 dollars the ton, of 4 hogsheads, (or
252 gallons,) to $600, according to the estimation they are held in.
The vines in this district are not suffered to grow above three feet
from the ground.

"_Hautbriant_ is produced on a single estate of that name, lying in
La Grave, about a league south of Bordeaux. The soil is sandy and
gravelly; so much so that you would hardly suppose it capable of
vegetation.

"The districts which produce _Sauterne_, _Barsac_, and _Grave_ wines,
lie from the skirts of the city south about four leagues, presenting
much the same swell of surface as that part of New Jersey through which
the mail runs between Trenton and Brunswick. The name of this district,
(or, more properly speaking, the northern part of it,) _Grave_, denotes
its soil _Gravier_--_Gravel_. I have seen hundreds of acres of vines in
_Grave_, growing in pebbles, from the size of a bean and nutmeg to that
of an egg, without the least vestige of earth, cracking under foot,
and filling one's shoes. Of the white wines of Bordeaux, _Sauterne_,
_Barsac_, and _Corbonnieux_ are of the first quality; but there are
many other growths which vie with them, and the ordinary qualities of
these white wines are various. I have purchased good pleasant white
wine at six dollars the cask of sixty-three gallons. The quantities
sent to this country cost from $12 the cask to $40. Of the other wines
you mention, I have no knowledge.

"It has been stated that two millions of acres are taken up in the
cultivation of the vine, in France, producing, one year with another,
five hogsheads of sixty-three gallons to the acre; which, at the
moderate price of fifty francs, or ten dollars, the hogshead, gives
one hundred millions of dollars. This produce is immense; and, what
renders it still more valuable is, that it does not lessen the quantity
of other necessary productions, such as wheat, &c.; for where the
vine generally grows _in France_, nothing else will grow: such is the
poverty of the soil generally employed for vines.

"They have the wild vine in France. I have seen large quantities of it
near _Bayonne_, and round the foot of the Pyrenees, up to _Pau_: the
inhabitants make beautiful hedges of it, and I have been assured by
a distinguished naturalist, Mr. Pennieres, who is now in the Alabama
territory, that some of the excellent grapes of France have been
produced from the wild vine, after some years of careful cultivation.
He is now engaged in inoculating our wild vines with those of France,
from which he expects the most favourable results.

"I shall conclude these hasty observations by an extract from _Rozier_:

"'The vine is a plant whose transpiration and _suction_ is _abundant_
and _vehement, which sufficiently indicates the soil and exposition
natural to it_. For this reason, grounds, _composed of sand, gravel
stones, and rotten rocks_, are excellent for its cultivation.

"'A _sandy_ soil produces _a fine pure_ wine. The _gravelly_ and
_stony_ a delicate wine. Rotten and broken rocks a fumy generous wine,
of a superior quality.

"'A rich, strong, compact, cold or humid soil, which is pressed down
by the rains, and which the sun hardens or bakes, is essentially
prejudicial to the quality of the wine.

"'The most advantageous exposition for the vine is that of a gentle
slope, or side of a hill, facing east and south, on which the rays of
the sun continue the longest time.

"'Hills, in the neighbourhood of the ocean and rivers, ought to be
preferred to all others.' The lower parts of these hills are not so
favourable to the vine as the upper, and neither are equal to the
middle region, the soil being the same.

"'_All trees are unfriendly to the vine_, as much from their roots as
their shade. All who cultivate the vine, should remember this precept
of Virgil: _Apertos Bacchus amat colles._--The vine flourishes in the
open unshaded hills.

"'In a word, the vine ought never to be planted in soils that can
produce grain, &c. because it wants nothing but heat, and thrives best
in the poorest ground. This will appear ridiculous to those who look
for _quantity_: but as to the quality of the wine, it is in strict
conformity with the laws of vegetation and with experience. I must
be understood to speak here of countries only whose temperatures are
favourable to the success of vineyards. We must except those in more
northern latitudes. These general precepts admit of no exceptions: They
will be acknowledged by all those who, with good faith, and free of
prejudices, have studied the cultivation of the vine. If other modes
and precepts are followed, we cannot answer for the age of the vine, or
the quality of the wine.'"

These views of the locality, soils, and exposures of the fine
_Bordeaux_ wines, such as the white, or _Sauterne_, and _vin de Grave_,
and the red or clarets, such as _La Fitte_, _Chateau Margaux_, &c. will
be left, for the present, on the public mind, with a firm confidence in
their due impression, accompanied by the remarks that the difference
between our temperatures, in our present wooded condition, and that
of the south west of France, may be safely taken at eleven or twelve
degrees; and that the progress of clearing lands and draining swamps
will reduce that difference, in a few years, below ten degrees. Thus,
St. Mary's, in Georgia, will ultimately prove about as warm, for
vegetation, as Oporto in Portugal, and the productions of Europe,
in any given latitude, may be found in, or, as we drain and clear,
introduced into the United States, in latitudes nine or ten degrees
farther south. The pride of all Europe is certainly the wines of the
following places:

ADDRESS.

Gentlemen of the Agricultural Society.

When you did me the honour of requesting me to deliver this Address,
you did not expect that I should enter into minute details of the
process of Agriculture. Such an attempt might expose my own ignorance,
but could not add to your information. The object of our Society is
_the promotion of Agriculture_. Whatever conduces to this end, either
immediately or even remotely, is worthy of our attention, and within
the scope of our Association. In this view of the subject, I perceive
so wide a range, that there is less difficulty in finding objects,
than in making a proper selection. To call forth the exertions of
the Society its zeal must be excited. But zeal is not to be excited,
without a conviction of the importance of the cause in which we are
engaged. May I be permitted then, to declare my conviction, that amidst
the profusion of Societies with which the present age abounds, there is
none more useful, or more dignified, than that for the _promotion of
Agriculture_. Indeed, in point of _utility_, I might justly say that
it _precedes_ all others. Because, even if mankind could exist without
Agriculture, yet they could exist only in a savage state, and in small
numbers. The great command "_increase and multiply_," could not be
obeyed. There could be nothing worthy the name of art, or science, or
literature. When I cast my eye on the map of Pennsylvania, and view
the vast quantity of excellent land, in the rude state in which nature
formed it, I am struck with astonishment at the multitudes which throng
our cities, struggling with hunger, cold, and disease. Nor is my wonder
confined to the lower orders of society. For I see many of liberal
education, and with the means of acquiring a competency in the country,
wasting their lives in disgraceful idleness, or fruitless efforts
to force their way through the crowds which block up every avenue
to profit or preferment. The flood of commerce which set upon our
shores during five and twenty years of war and disorder in Europe, has
given to our cities a premature growth. In every branch of trade and
commerce there are too many competitors. Labourers are too numerous.
Every mechanic art, every liberal profession is overdone. Happy would
it be for the city, and happy for the country, if any efforts of this
Society could inspire a respect, and a taste, for an _art_ in which no
man need be ashamed to employ his faculties; for a _condition_, which
after all, seems most congenial to the nature of man. It is a life,
to which, at one time or other, we all aspire. For who is there, that
amidst the eager pursuit of wealth or ambition, does not sometimes
pause, and console himself with the fond, though often fallacious hope,
of passing his latter days in the independence, the ease, the plenty,
the safety, and the innocence of the country! In Pennsylvania, young
men of education would have peculiar advantages in spreading themselves
through the country, for it is a fact (and we are every day feeling
the effects of it) that in no state in the union, is education so much
confined to towns. There are many inhabitants of this city, who hold
extensive tracts of land, which neither they nor their children have
ever seen. This is a bad state of things. For, through ignorance of
the quality, the situation, and value of their lands, these persons
are sometimes a prey to speculators, and sometimes, erring on the
contrary extreme, they conceive extravagant notions, and refuse to
sell at a fair price. Hence Agriculture suffers--either the land
remains a desert, or they are occupied by poor intruders, who knowing
the instability of their title, are afraid to attempt any valuable
improvement. These people, with few exceptions, lead a wretched life,
and are apt to imbibe sentiments hostile to the proprietors of the
soil, whom they consider as natural enemies. Could the parties but see
each other, very different feelings might prevail. A little kindness
and condescension on the part of the proprietor, might convert a
discontented trespasser, into a useful tenant or purchaser. That this
has happened in many instances, I know; which induces me to think,
that were the trial made, it would happen in many more. Where large
property of this kind, is in the hands of heads of families with
several children, one or two of the sons might manage the estate to
great advantage, by living on the spot. Agents are expensive, and often
unfaithful. But one may confide in his own blood. Besides, the very
circumstance of a well educated young man residing in any place, will
naturally attract others of similar qualifications, to the same spot;
and thus an agreeable society might be formed, and great encouragement
afforded to the labouring poor of the neighbourhood. In this kind
of policy, the state of New York has set us a good example. And the
consequences of her conduct are obvious; a greater proportion of her
lands is settled, and her unsettled lands, of equal quality, sell for
a higher price than ours. Although the views of our society are not
confined to the limits of the state, and our earnest wishes are for
the prosperity of the whole, and every part of the union, yet it may
be considered as our duty to direct our attention more particularly
to Pennsylvania. We cannot be accused then of acting with ungenerous
policy, if we endeavour to promote the settlement of our own lands in
preference to those of our neighbours. We may, without impropriety,
suggest all fair and honourable arguments, to convince the emigrants
from the eastern states, and from Europe, that it is their interest
to establish themselves here, rather than seek a residence in a
distant country, to the west or the south. It is not my intention to
enter deeply into this subject. It might be enough, to suggest to the
Society, the utility of circulating good pamphlets, which have already
been written, or may be written hereafter. But, one or two leading
facts it may not be amiss to mention. The rich productions of the
south, are not to be attained, but by men of considerable capital.
The object is tempting, but when offered to the consideration of
emigrants from Europe, or our sister states to the eastward, they will
remember that the climate where rice, cotton, tobacco, indigo, and
sugar flourish, is generally unfavourable to health; and that these
articles are not to be cultivated to advantage, without slaves. They
have therefore to engage in a new kind of life, opposed to the habits
and principles in which they have been educated, and which, however
flattering the outset, will probably terminate in an enfeebled body and
discontented mind.

But the great class of emigrants, is that of people who have small
capitals, and must seek their bread, by the labour of their own hands.
To such persons, health is every thing. The languid eye of sickness
dwells without pleasure, on the fairest prospects of nature. In vain is
the fertile bottom, or the rich prairie, offered to the arm unnerved
by disease. It is a notorious fact, that rich, low, level countries,
are subject to fevers. They should therefore be shunned by those who
are to live by their own labour. Another great inconvenience in those
countries is, that they are badly supplied with water, either for
drinking or machinery. If, indeed, the lands in the western region,
were extremely cheap, and those in Pennsylvania at a price beyond
the reach of a poor man, he must go to the west from necessity. But
that is not the case,--our lands are believed to be as low priced, as
those beyond the Ohio; and much more so, when there is taken into the
calculation (as there ought to be) the expense of the journey. Another
important circumstance in our favour, is a much better market for the
sale of our productions, and the purchase of necessary articles. This
is important at all times, but peculiarly in war, when the Mississippi,
the only inlet or outlet of the whole western country, may be blockaded
by a hostile fleet.

       *       *       *       *       *

Let it not be supposed, that the interests of Agriculture and of
Commerce are at variance. On the contrary, they are inseparable. Of
this the Agriculturists of the United States have had good proof.
No persons on earth have profited more by commerce. During the long
wars of Europe, the staple productions of the middle states sold at
double price, and those of the southern states were very high, both
during the war and after. Those prices were produced, in part, by the
influx of wealth, which occasioned an increased consumption at home,
and in part by exportation to foreign countries, but principally by
the latter. Both causes, however, sprang from commerce; and both, as
long as commerce exists, will continue to operate in a greater or
less degree. Indeed, if we could suppose a nation cut off from all
intercourse with other nations, (that is, from all foreign commerce)
that nation, though abounding in all the necessaries of life, would be
barbarous, selfish, illiteral, and ignorant. Neither let us give way to
the idea, that either agriculture, or commerce, are incompatible with
domestic manufactures. Unwise laws, may injure either one or the other,
by unjust preferences; but under proper regulations, they will aid,
and invigorate each other. This is not the place for entering into a
disquisition of the degree of encouragement which should be afforded by
_law_, to manufactures. That important subject is before the national
legislature, where it will no doubt, receive an impartial and mature
consideration. But thus much may be said, with certainty; that it is
the _duty_, as well as the _interest_, of all of us, to use _our own_,
in preference to _foreign_ manufactures, where they can be furnished
on reasonable terms. It cannot be denied, that manufactures afford a
sure market, for the productions of the neighbouring country; and as
they are multiplied, in the same ratio, are the markets increased. And
there is a peculiar advantage in markets of this kind, at a distance
from navigable waters; that, the consumption being at home, the
expense of carriage is saved. But, there is a kind of manufacture,
_domestic in the strictest sense_, the benefit of which is inestimable,
because while it adds to the _stock_ of the family, it protects their
_morals_.--I allude to spinning, weaving, and such things as are
done by the hands of the husband, the wife, or the children, without
leaving their home. It guards them against _idleness_, that child of
folly, and parent of vice, and is often clear gain, as it occupies
those hours which would have been passed in inaction. I am afraid,
that in this kind of industry, we have rather degenerated. A very
respectable gentleman, a member of the Society of Friends, informed me,
that about the year 1764, he attended a meeting, in Chester county,
near the borders of Maryland, and that most of his society in that
neighbourhood, were clothed _completely_ and _handsomely_ in dress
of their own manufacture. Were he to visit that meeting now, I doubt
whether he would see his friends in the same kind of apparel. Yet
meritorious examples are not wanting, even now, and I hope I shall be
excused for mentioning one lately communicated to me. In the western
part of Pennsylvania, on this side of the Alleghany river, lives a
man, who, ten or twelve years ago, seated himself on a tract of land,
to which he had no title, in the humble character of a _squatter_.[11]
This man has converted a wilderness into a fine farm; and, with the
assistance of an industrious wife, brought up a large family of
children. He raises on his farm all the materials for clothing the
family; and whatever they wear, of linen or woollen texture, excellent
in their kinds, is spun, woven, and manufactured in the house. They
also make their own sugar, from the maple; and their own leather; and
_purchase_ (or rather _barter_ for) nothing but iron, and salt. Their
farming utensils are chiefly homemade.--But what is more commendable
than all (and perhaps the cause of all) _very little whiskey or ardent
spirits is drunk_ by any of them. To finish the picture, I have to add,
that the proprietor of the land, with views, no less _politic_ than
_liberal_, has confirmed these good people in their title, on moderate
terms--so that this little story contains a moral, from which, both
_settlers_, and _proprietors_, may profit.

[11] A term in use, in New York and Pennsylvania, to denote a man who
seats himself on land to which he has no title.

It has been apprehended by some, that the late fall in the price of
land, and its productions, would damp the ardour of cultivators,
and deter men of capital from employing their funds in the purchase
of real property. This apprehension appears to be ill founded. If
the profits of farming have been diminished, so likewise have the
profits of all other business; so that there is no particular reason
for withholding funds from an investment in land. We are in a state
of distress, which I trust, will be but temporary; for the country
has great resources, and sufficient knowledge to bring them into
action. A stagnation of commerce was to be expected, on the cessation
of the wars in Europe.[12] But this stagnation is not peculiar to
America--she shares it in common with all the world--we have indeed,
particular distress, arising from our own errors, on the subject of
banks. An immoderate issue of bank paper, afforded an unhappy facility
of borrowing. The money when borrowed, must be made use of in some
way--many of the borrowers, having no good use for it, either trifled
it away, in unnecessary expenses, or in the purchase of land, which
soon rose, nominally, to twice its value. Such a state of things could
not last long--the delusion is past. It is to be lamented, that many
good people have been the victims of this infatuation; but we must
comfort ourselves with the hope, that some good will result from it, if
a cure is not attempted by rash and violent means. As a people, we had
become too extravagant and too luxurious. The slow but sure progress
of industry was despised. Every man was in haste to be rich, by some
visionary project, dignified with the name of _speculation_. But we
are now suffering for these follies, and by suffering, we shall be
purified, and brought back to better habits. This will be a lasting
good. Instead of desponding then, let us prosecute our business with
increased vigour and economy, and we shall soon find, that although
we have fewer paper dollars, we have more real wealth, and what is of
much greater importance, better morals, and of course more happiness.
A large capital is at present locked up, because the owners are in
doubt how to employ it. When business shall flow in decided channels,
this capital will be brought into activity. It is almost certain, that
neither commerce, nor bank stock will be as profitable as they have
been; so that there is a strong probability of an investment of a
large capital, in real estate, which, after all, possesses a stability
unknown to any other kind of property.

[12] In a letter of the late President Adams, published since the
delivery of this Address, he says he remembers that the like depression
of commerce, manufactures and real estate, took place after the wars,
which ended in 1748, 1763, and 1783.

But, it is in our own power, to increase the value of our lands by
an improved state of Agriculture. Much has been done, but much more
remains to be done. Though not at the bottom of the hill, we have
not yet ascended half its height. It may be encouraging however to
stop for a moment, and take a glance at the progress we have made.
Before the war of the revolution, little of science was blended with
the art of agriculture--things had gone on in their natural course.
The counties first settled, now known by the names of Philadelphia,
Delaware, Chester, Montgomery, and Bucks, though not rich (except the
meadows) were sufficient to yield good crops at first, and tolerable
ones for a number of years. But the soil near the surface, composed of
vegetable substances accumulated during the lapse of ages, became at
length exhausted by repeated tillage without refreshment. Red clover
was introduced before the war, but it was produced in small quantities,
and almost solely for the purpose of hay. The system of melioration by
a rotation of crops, in which grass took its turn, was not understood.
Natural meadow was in great demand, and not much hay being produced
on the uplands, it was impossible to support during winter, a stock
sufficiently large to amass a great quantity of manure. Consequently
the crops of grain, and particularly of wheat were much diminished.
Indeed, the _wheat_ crops were trifling. Gypsum had been imported, in
small quantities before the revolution; but it was very little used,
and very little talked of; and that little not to its credit, for an
old proverb, said to come from Germany, was brought up against it,
"_that gypsum made rich fathers, but poor sons_." Notwithstanding this
prejudice, it was brought into general use, some years after the war,
by the persevering efforts of a few, _and principally of the President
of this Society_, to whom future generations will render thanks for
this important service. Through the efficacy of this fossil, the face
of the country experienced a magic change. The uplands were clothed
with rich herbage, to which succeeded plenteous crops of grain. I have
not been able to trace with certainty, the progress of the cultivation
of clover aided by gypsum, but I believe, that Philadelphia was the
centre, from which it spread in all directions. In Chester county, so
great were its effects, that (as I heard it proved in the trial of a
cause at West Chester,) the price of lands was doubled in a few years.
Nor is there any reason to suppose that it was less beneficial in other
places.

But as the excess of even a good thing may be pernicious, so may it be
with gypsum. That it promotes the growth of many vegetables, and of
clover in particular, is certain; though its mode of operation does
not seem to be clearly understood. An increased quantity of grass,
will support an increased quantity of stock, from which will proceed
an increased quantity of manure, and that should be considered as the
great end of gypsum. Not that great advantages may not be derived
from ploughing in the green clover. But if that is relied on, as the
only mode of meliorating the soil, (and in some publications which I
have seen, it is asserted to be quite sufficient) we shall probably
be disappointed. In Sir John Sinclair's Code of Agriculture, it is
said that the practice of ploughing in green vegetables, as a manure,
has been tried, in England, and found not to answer; and that more
benefit is derived from those crops, when they are consumed by stock,
and converted into dung; and Col. John Taylor, (of Caroline county,
Virginia) to whose valuable labours the world is so much indebted,
is also of opinion, that we ought not to rely on green vegetables
only. In the first edition of his _Arator_, he seemed to think, that
nothing more was necessary than clover, but in the second edition, he
acknowledged his error, which had been demonstrated by the result of
two crops of Indian corn. In 80 acres of land, improved by turning in
the grass, without other manure, the crop averaged 25 bushels an acre.
But in 200 acres, where the clover was turned in and the ground also
manured, the average was 50 bushels. It is probable, indeed, that the
ploughing in of clover, may have a greater effect in many parts of
the United States, than in England. For, that large crops of grain
have been produced by it, is so strongly attested, that it must not
be denied. This may be owing to the Superior efficacy of the gypsum,
which, no doubt, acts more powerfully here, than generally in England,
and therefore produces a greater quantity of clover. But, as it is
certain, that the manure of dung, incorporated with putrefied vegetable
matter, is more efficacious than simple green vegetables; what I
intend, is to exhort our farmers not to trust to the latter alone, nor
relax their efforts to collect the former in as great quantities as
possible.

Another important circumstance is to be attended to. We are not to
expect, that land will continue to produce luxuriant crops of clover,
for ever, even when aided by gypsum.--It would be contrary to the order
of nature; which delights in change. Our _second_ crop of clover,
has, for many years, been of little value, though the cause remains
unexplained. A gentleman of veracity, who lives on the Delaware,
between eight or ten miles above the city, assured me, that gypsum,
which had done wonders for a long time, had at length ceased to have
any effect on his land; and that the same was the case of some of his
neighbours. I am informed also, that the same remark has been made by
farmers in Montgomery county. Now it is not to be supposed, that the
gypsum has changed its nature, or lost its virtue.--But the earth,
being exhausted of those particles which are favourable to the growth
of clover, no longer offers to the gypsum the same matter to act upon.
That the matter, necessary for the formation of a particular plant, may
be exhausted, while the same earth suffices for the vigorous production
of other plants, is proved by daily experience; and is an accordance
with the best theory.

In a late English publication, there is an offer of a considerable
premium to the person who shall discover a grass which shall be a good
substitute for clover, it being understood that clover no longer grew
as formerly; and of another premium to the person who shall discover
the means of restoring lands, which once bore clover, to a capacity of
producing it again. It would, therefore, be wise in us, to look out in
time, for some grass, to take the place of clover, when it shall be
found no longer to succeed. In the mean time, we may avail ourselves
(and it may perhaps be a very long time) of the united efficacy of
gypsum and clover.

I said that we had much to do before we attained that degree of
perfection which was practicable in agriculture. I presume, that our
lands, in their natural state, were full as good as those of England.
In England, the average crops of grain of all kinds, on 8,000,000
of acres, are estimated at twenty-four bushels the acre. I take
this estimate from Sir John Sinclair, who says, moreover, that in
"fertile districts and propitious seasons, from thirty-two to forty
bushels of wheat an acre, may be confidently expected; from forty-two
to fifty of barley, from fifty-two to sixty-four of oats, and from
twenty-eight to thirty-two of beans." The best county in Pennsylvania,
is supposed to be Lancaster. The matter cannot be spoken of with any
kind of certainty; but, from the best information I have been able to
collect, I should doubt whether the _wheat_ crops of the whole county
of Lancaster, averaged more than fifteen bushels an acre, though many
individual farmers get from twenty to thirty; and some from thirty to
forty. But, when we compare the agriculture of two countries, we must
take it in large masses. Penn's Valley, in Pennsylvania, is supposed to
yield crops of _wheat_, averaging at least twenty bushels an acre; but
that is owing to something peculiar in the climate; for the crops do
not ripen in less than two weeks later than in most other parts of the
state. The soil in Penn's valley, is limestone, and the water lies very
deep.

There is no doubt, however, that the agriculture of Pennsylvania is
steadily improving, and is at present actually improved as highly as
that of any state in the union. In buildings for agricultural purposes
(perhaps too expensive) she is unrivalled; so that without being over
sanguine, we may promise ourselves an annual increase of the value of
our lands. How this progress may be quickened, is a question which
this Society should keep constantly in view.--To devise the means
of acceleration, should be their study.--To the first great step
towards general improvement, the organization of societies in every
part of the state, we have one what was in our power, by petitioning
the legislature to take the subject into consideration, and aid the
undertaking with necessary funds. Nor is there any reason to doubt
of success; for the legislature is always liberal when the general
interest demands it. The institution of county societies, with the
distribution of premiums, will be a powerful stimulus to the dormant
faculties of thousands. The Eastern States, including New York, have
already made the experiment with success; and I honour them for the
example. Our Society, being situated in the capital, has the best
means of correspondence; so that we can reciprocate information on
agricultural subjects, with the different societies throughout this,
and other states, and with countries beyond the sea. Hence will be
collected a stock of knowledge, which being condensed, and methodized,
may be offered to the public with great advantage.

A pattern farm is an object we have long had at heart, and it is not
to be relinquished. But the time is not come, for carrying our wishes
into effect. At present, we have not sufficient funds; and to incur a
debt, in our corporate capacity, without the means of payment, would
justly dishonour us. But the want of a pattern farm may be in some
measure supplied, by the exertions of members of the society, who
possess farms within a few miles of the city. Some of them are blessed
with ample means, as well as inclination, to give a fair trial to every
improvement which can be rationally suggested, either in instruments
of husbandry, the application of manures, or the cultivation of new
plants, grains, or grasses.

We may render ourselves useful, by collecting and diffusing the
information contained in books recently published in Europe or America.
In Europe the principal nobility and gentry are paying due honours to
Agriculture. Chemistry has been called to her aid, from which important
discoveries must result. Earths, minerals, and manures of all kinds are
analysed. Philosophy is in the right path. Facts are first ascertained,
and then accounted for. The increased power of magnifying glasses,
lays open the hidden parts of plants, and minute animals. Hence may be
discovered the _causes_, and consequently the _cure_, of many disorders
by which plants are infested. Already it is asserted, (I vouch not for
the truth of it) that the disease in wheat called the _smut_, is no
other than a parasite plant, which adhering to the seed-wheat, grows
with it, and may be destroyed by proper applications, before the seed
is sown. Perhaps some fortunate observer may let us into the nature
of that scourge of Agriculture, known by the name of the Hessian fly,
so that we may get rid of it, as we did of the weevil fly, some forty
years ago. Such a man would deserve a statue of gold, and I think the
farmers would gladly erect it.

Another point of duty, to which we have not been wanting, is the
importation of such foreign grains, grasses, and plants, as are
suitable to our climate. Of all the grains which now grow in the
middle states, I recollect none, but maize, (Indian corn) which
is native. Perhaps we have not yet collected all which might be
profitably cultivated; and even if we have, a change of seed is of
great importance. What wealth has flowed into the southern states, from
cotton, which, thirty years ago, was scarce known there! Something new
is always turning up, and we should be on the alert, to avail ourselves
of it.

The Society has heretofore given admonition of the necessity of change
in seed-grain. I do not mean merely the change of one grain for another
of a different kind, (as _wheat_ for _rye_, &c.) but a change of seed,
where there is no change of kind. Farmers do not seem aware of this
necessity, nor of the great advantage of procuring seed of the very
best kind, and cleaning it in the most perfect manner. Or if they are
aware, they are deterred from paying attention to it, by a little
trouble and a little expense. It would be well to keep the subject
before their eyes, until a conviction of its importance shall produce
an alteration of practice.

The importation of foreign animals is not to be neglected. It is not
the business of this Society, nor have they the means of importing
them;--but they may point them out. We have, in Pennsylvania, good
horses; but in the best breeds of cattle, hogs and sheep, we are
defective. I know that some enterprising gentlemen in the city have
gone to great expense in importing cattle, and others are in possession
of excellent breeds of hogs, but they are not yet diffused through
the state. It is understood, that in the Eastern States, no pains or
expense have been spared, in procuring animals of the finest shape
and quality. But it may be some time, before they have a surplus for
exportation.

We are well situated for obtaining models of all newly invented
implements of husbandry. Our workmen are ingenious, and able to execute
any thing which is planned for them; and the genius of our countrymen
in the application of the mechanic powers, is conspicuous. The high
price of labour, rendered its abridgement of primary importance. What
wonderful effects have been produced by Whitney's cotton gin? We are
well supplied with implements for breaking the earth, and for cutting
all kinds of straw, and cheap machines for shelling Indian corn. But a
machine effectual for the threshing of wheat, and not too high-priced,
is a desideratum. The machine for dressing flax, of British invention,
is said to be a very great improvement, but is not yet much in use
among us.

Roads, bridges, canals, and all internal public improvements, are
subjects, which though not within our control, have such an immediate
bearing on Agriculture, by expediting and cheapening carriage, that
it will be always proper to do what little is in our power, for their
success. Works of such magnitude are not to be executed, without the
combined exertions of many persons, sanctioned by the authority of the
legislature, and assisted by the public purse. Our legislature has
done nobly for roads and bridges, and we trust it will do the same for
canals. The first great object of that kind, is the junction of the
waters of the Susquehanna and the Schuylkill, which empties into the
Delaware. That being accomplished, we may look westward to the waters
of the Alleghany, and northward to the Seneca lake, which being once
entered, and entered it may be with no great difficulty, we have the
Delaware connected with the great northern lakes, by means of the
magnificent work now in rapid progress, in the state of New York. The
project is grand;--I may not live to see it executed, yet it is by no
means so improbable as many things once appeared, which in my time have
been accomplished.

Yet, it must be confessed, that in canals, we linger behind other
states, who have boldly led the way. Except the works now carrying
on, for the improvement of the navigation on the Schuylkill and the
Lehigh, we have nothing to show but the Conewago canal of a single
mile, which will be of little use, unless the Susquehanna and Delaware
are united. Our tardiness may be accounted for. Five and twenty years
ago, when the Conewago canal was begun, public spirit mounted perhaps
too high. Great efforts were made, which, from causes not necessary
now to mention, proved abortive.--Hence, a despondence on the subject
of canals, from which we have scarce yet recovered. But it is high
time to rouse ourselves. On the one side we have New York making great
and successful exertions; on the other, Maryland, endeavouring to
avail herself of the road, made at the expense of the United States,
from Cumberland, on the Potowmac, to Wheeling, on the Ohio; on which
wagons travel free from toll. But, if we can have water carriage from
Philadelphia to Susquehanna, we shall be on a better footing than
Baltimore; and preserve our wagon carriage to Pittsburg until the
Susquehanna shall be joined to the Alleghany. This wagon carriage is
of immense importance. It has been supposed, that between Philadelphia
and Pittsburg, the yearly sum paid for carriage, amounted to 730,000
dollars. Nor is this the only consideration. A very great sum is
expended all along the line of the turnpike road, which is diffused
through the country to a considerable distance. A six horse wagon
consumes five bushels of oats a day, besides hay. Now, it appears from
an official return, made by the keeper of the turnpike gate, at the
Chesnut Ridge, between Stoys Town, and Greensburg, that there passed
through that gate, during the year ending May, 1818; among other
things, 281 four-horse, 2412 five-horse, and 2698 six-horse teams; and
it is said, that a gentleman, living on the road near Pittsburg, in the
year 1813, counted the number of wagons, laden with merchandize, which
passed his house that year, and that they amounted to 4055. Through the
counties of Bedford and Somerset, the road, being generally on ridges,
runs through a poor country, to which the market afforded by the
wagons, is essential. Somerset abounds in _grass_; and for _oats_ is
superior to any county in the state.--But the soil is not favourable to
wheat; and, except in the southern part, Indian corn will scarce arrive
at maturity. It appears, clearly, therefore, that the Agriculture
of Pennsylvania is very much interested, even in parts far west of
the Susquehanna, in a water communication between that river and the
Delaware, as the most effectual means of preserving the land carriage
to Pittsburg. Another weighty consideration is, the protection which
ought to be afforded to Pittsburg, against the effect of the United
States' turnpike from Cumberland to Wheeling. Pittsburg ought to be to
the western part of the state, what Philadelphia is to the eastern: the
reservoir of wealth sufficient to afford a market to the surrounding
country. There is no rivalship between these cities. The prosperity of
one promotes the prosperity of the other. Why then should we hesitate?
New York has completed 120 miles of canal in less than two years and
five months. By a line of less than half that length, the Delaware and
Susquehanna are united.

Pennsylvania has been accused of want of attention to gardening, and I
am afraid she must plead guilty to the charge. A good kitchen garden
contributes much to the health, and even the elegance of life; the
saving of meat makes it a source of economy, and the neatness which is
necessary to keep it in order, may have an effect on the _manners_
of the family. The females might execute a good deal of the work, and
for their sake it should be interspersed with flowers. I believe my
feelings are not at all singular, and I declare that I am struck with
a sensation of pleasure, at the sight of a flourishing, well enclosed
garden. May I be allowed to add, that I have the same feelings, at
sight of a neat inclosure in front of the dwelling house, separating
it from the highway. With surprise and regret, I perceive this often
neglected, by wealthy and liberal farmers, merely because they have
been in the habit of living without it. Such things might be remedied
at a very trifling expense, but they are of no trifling consequence.
They have an influence on manners.

I say nothing on the subject of _hedges_, their importance, and the
best mode of raising them have been fully shown by one of our Vice
Presidents, on a former occasion.

The limits of this discourse confine me to _hints_, on subjects which
merit _treatises_. May not means be taken to tincture the youthful
mind, with the spirit of Agriculture? In _colleges_, natural philosophy
and chemistry might sometimes be directed to that special purpose.
But something may be done at an _earlier age_; particularly where
opportunities are offered, in teaching the learned languages, which
being acquired slowly and with difficulty, leave lasting impressions;
for instance, besides the Georgics of Virgil, which are in general use,
select passages might be read from Columella, one of the most ancient
writers on rural affairs, which have reached us, in the Latin tongue.
I am afraid mischief is done, by putting into the hands of boys, those
finished models of Grecian and Roman eloquence, in which are painted,
in too vivid colours, the pleasures of wine, and love, and the glory of
war.

Having touched the subject of education, I will add, that when the
benevolent intention of the constitution of Pennsylvania, shall be
carried into effect, by "_the establishment of schools throughout
the state, in such manner, that the poor may be taught gratis_,"
Agriculture will reap her full share of the benefit. Reading, writing,
and common arithmetic, if not essential, are very serviceable to the
farmer. And even the labourer will derive incalculable advantage from
the improvement of his intellectual faculties. Work cannot be continued
without intermission, and time hangs heavy on the mind which is torpid
during the hours of repose. Exercise is as necessary to the mind as
the body. How desirable then, that men should be qualified for that
kind of reading, which gratifies and strengthens the mind, without the
fatigue of severe study, while the body is at rest during the intervals
of labour? Our legislature is not unmindful of the duty imposed by the
constitution--the act "to provide for the education of children at the
public expense within the city and county of Philadelphia," is working
great good. By the first annual report of the controllers of these
schools, made in February last, it appears that 2845 children were then
in a course of education; and I am informed that the number is now
much increased. Moreover, a most important fact is established--that
by adopting the Lancasterian mode of teaching, which will do in all
thickly settled districts, the annual expense will not exceed _four
dollars_ for each child. Upon efforts like these the blessing of God
may be confidently hoped for.

Nothing can be more effectual for the diffusion of the spirit of
Christianity, than a moderate cultivation of the understanding. Men
will thus become more mild, better content with the condition in which
Providence has placed them, more attentive to their duties both moral
and religious, more charitable towards each other, less jealous and
vindictive in their feelings towards foreign nations, less prone to
rapine, under whatever name disguised, and less easily dazzled by the
false splendour of war.

But I must indulge myself on this topic no longer, lest it seduce me
from my main design.

Closely connected with Agriculture is the subject of leases. Though
not so important in the United States, as in other countries, because
the body of tenantry is smaller here, yet it is not undeserving of
attention. The leases generally in use, are for a short term, with a
reservation, by way of rent, of a certain share of the produce of the
land. This system is liable to two great objections. The shortness of
the tenure, precludes all hope of improvement of the soil, and the mode
of payment, (the rendering a share of the crop,) holds out inducements
to fraud, which few tenants are able to resist. When the landlord
lives upon the estate, he has some chance of checking the tenant, by
obtaining an accurate knowledge of the amount of the crop; and if he
is liberal, he may have something done in the way of improvement. But
where he lives at a distance, the probability is, that the estate
will go to ruin, while he receives but a small part of his due.
The objections to long leases, for rents in money, are, that if the
landlord parts with the possession for a long time, he may be injured
by a bad tenant; that he precludes himself from the chance of a sale,
if a good price should be offered, and that the great fluctuations in
the price of grain, make it impossible to fix a rent in money, without
danger to both parties. Where a man has it in view to sell his estate,
he may be right, in making a short lease; that case forms an exception
to the general rule. But where he means to keep it, the objection is
removed; then, as to fluctuation of price, the matter might be easily
managed, by reserving a rent of a certain quantity of grain, giving the
tenant an election to pay the market price, in money, which might be
more convenient than delivering the grain. That point being settled, a
lease for a longer term, fixing the rotation in which the fields should
be cultivated, with other proper covenants, would leave the landlord
sufficiently protected, while it gave the tenant encouragement to
meliorate the soil for his own interest. At the end of such a lease,
the value of the estate would be increased, and the rent might be
raised. With great deference I submit these remarks to gentlemen of the
city, who have farms at some distance, or even in the neighbourhood,
which are intended as a provision for their families.

One thing more remains, which I cannot in conscience pass by, and in
which, perhaps the Society may find means to do some good. Can no
method be devised, to check the inordinate use of spirituous liquors?
This shocking habit, strikes at the root of agriculture, by robbing it
of the labour necessary for its support. It would be a waste of time,
to enumerate the ills which flow from this disgraceful vice, because
they are obvious to everyone. Perhaps a small addition to the wages,
would induce labourers to forego the use of this poisonous liquid; or
they might consent to take as a substitute, beer, or cider, or some
other harmless drink. The subject deserves the deepest consideration,
and I cannot help hoping, that when societies shall be organized in the
several counties, a plan may be formed, which being acted upon at once,
throughout the state, may greatly lessen, if not eradicate the evil.

I have endeavoured, gentlemen, to obey your commands, in hopes that my
example may call forth the efforts of others, better qualified to do
justice to the subject.




_Law Case._


The following opinion delivered by JACOB RUSH, President of the Court
of Common Pleas of the City and County of Philadelphia, will be found
particularly interesting by persons residing in the Country, and who
may be exposed to controversies about line fences, and their repairs.
The examination of the provisions of the act of Assembly, and of
the principles of law on the points involved in the case will be
interesting and useful to every Lawyer.

  Overseers of the Poor  } Common Pleas, Philadelphia
      of Byberry,        }       County,
        _vs._            }     Certiorari.
        F.I.             }

A Certiorari issued out of this Court, directed to Joshua Jones and
Elisha Gordon, Esquires, requiring them to transmit certain proceedings
had before them under the fence law of 1700, in which John T.
Townshend and Israel Walton, Overseers of the poor of Byberry are the
complainants, and F. I. the defendant.

Prior to stating the facts on the return, it will be proper to give a
brief exposition of the very obscure law upon which the controversy has
arisen.

The act of 1700, for the regulation of fences, gives authority to fence
viewers in two cases.--1st. Where a person finding a fence actually
erected, takes advantage of such existing fence, and makes it a part of
a subsequent enclosure. The person making such subsequent enclosure,
and deriving a benefit from his neighbours fence, is bound to pay one
half the expense of such fence. He is equally bound afterwards himself
to keep in repair one half of it, or to pay the expense of repairing
it.--Which leads to the 2d. point, and this consists in the power
the fence viewers have over fences, either erected or subsequently
divided, by agreement between two neighbours. The fence viewers cannot
compel a person to join fences with his neighbour, every man having an
undoubted right to erect a fence upon his own ground. The authority
of the viewers is derived from the consent of the parties expressed
or implied. In the case of a person deriving a benefit from making a
fence actually existing, a part of the enclosure around his own field,
he virtually agrees by his conduct, to make compensation.--In the 2d.
case, viz: repairing fences, the parties are supposed to have joined
originally in erecting the fence, or by some subsequent contract, to
have come under an engagement to keep in repair a moity of the fence.

The viewers being only judges of the value, or of the sufficiency of
fences, cannot order a _new_ fence to be erected. In the former case,
that is, the value, they are to award compensation; in the latter,
they are to direct the party delinquent to repair the fence, and in
case of his neglecting it for ten days, then upon application and
proof thereof before two Justices, they are to order the _persons
aggrieved_ to repair the fence, who shall be reimbursed by the party
refusing to repair the fence. When the party _aggrieved_, has repaired
the the fence, in obedience to the order of the two justices, the
fence viewers, who by the law are the _sole judges_ of the charge to
be borne by the delinquent, must be called upon to fix the amount
of compensation, to be reimbursed by the delinquent, for which sum,
together with costs, the justices are required to issue a warrant
against him to be levied upon his goods and chattels.

If the viewers and the two justices have in all respects conformed to
the law, and have kept _within_ their jurisdiction, the facts cannot
_now_ be controverted. What are the facts in this case?

The viewers have been legally summoned to view and examine a fence
which separates the lands of the complainant's from the land of the
defendants. They say they were called to view a _partition fence_
between the said parties, and that on such examination, they found the
defendant's part to be deficient, or not lawful, and that they directed
him to make a good and sufficient fence _on the line_ within ten days.
This order of the viewers is dated 21st January, 1815.

The defendants having neglected to repair the fence for _more_ than
ten days, the complainants did according to law, apply to two justices
for an order to be issued to him to repair the fence, which order, the
said justices, after being satisfied by due proof, that the defendant
had neglected to repair the fence, for ten days, did issue on the 26th
August, 1815.--To this order the complainants have returned to the
justices that they have complied therewith and repaired the fence.

As far as the proceedings have gone, every thing has been done
agreeable to the law.

Four exceptions however have been filed by the defendant. The first and
second objections may be comprised in one, and present a difficulty
of a legal nature, that the complainants represent a corporate body,
and are therefore not included in the law that relates to fences.--If
this objection were well founded, its operation would be conclusive
in favour of the defendant, because a law that does not bind both
parties in interest, never ought to be carried into execution against
_either_.--In our opinion, however, the law in the case before us
includes _corporate bodies_, as well as natural persons. The statute
22. H. 8. ch. 5. for the repair of bridges which subjects to taxation,
the _inhabitants_ of every Shire, Riding, City, or Town, and for
non-payment of which their goods may be seized and sold, has been
universally acknowledged and held to include _Corporations_. 2 inst.
703. comp. 79. Sir T. Jones 167.

The word _Inhabitants_, says Sir Edward Coke, is the largest word of
the kind, and includes every corporation or Body Politic, residing in
any County, Riding, City or Town. To these authorities we shall only
add, that in 2 Bac. Abr. Wilson's Edition, page 10, it is expressly
laid down, that _Corporations_ in the character of _owners_ or
_occupiers_ of houses or lands, are subject to the same burden to which
_individuals_ are subject, in the same character.

The good sense of these decisions, must strike every body, as their
tendency is to place natural and artificial bodies on the same footing.

The third exception filed by the defendant, viz: that the two justices
ordered the complainants to put up the fence, _without_ requiring proof
that the defendant had _not_ complied with the order of the viewers,
is destitute of foundation. The record of the justices show that this
exception is founded in mistake.

The fourth exception is, that the viewers had no authority to order the
defendant to put up and repair his fence _on the line_.

It is certain they could not order him to put it up or repair it _off
the line_; and having directed him to repair it _on the line_, cannot
invalidate the order. Viewing the words, _on the line_, in the most
exceptionable light, they can be deemed nothing but surplusage. The
substantial drift of the order is, that the defendant shall repair the
fence.

With respect to the affidavit of the defendant of the 6th of January,
1816, that he has enclosed completely the burial ground on his _own_
ground, leaving an interval of 10 feet between the line of the burial
ground and the fence he has put up, the Court would remark, that
generally speaking, a man has a right to put up a fence upon his own
land, and as many as he pleases. A man must however so exercise his
right, as not to injure those of another. Having once joined fences
with his neighbours he cannot, when ordered to repair his share of
it, evade the law, by removing it, and placing it altogether upon his
_own_ ground. Where the law has once laid its hands upon a man, he
must not be allowed to escape from its operation. Nothing can meet the
approbation of a Court, that would look like an evasion of the law. A
man cannot in one and the same breath, say he is bound and not bound.
Whether a person might remove his share of a _division fence_ and
place it upon his _own_ ground, prior to an inspection by the fence
viewers, is a point not now before the Court. But we are very clearly
of opinion, removing a fence _after_ it had been repaired in obedience
to the order of two Justices, cannot exempt him from the operation of
the law.

There being no error in point of law in the proceedings removed, the
judgment of the Court is, they must be confirmed.

MISCELLANY.


_Modes of salutation._--From the form of salutations among different
nations we may learn something of their character, at least of their
manners. In the southern provinces of China the common people ask "Ya
Tan," that is, How have you eaten your rice; for in that is their
greatest felicity. If two Dutchmen meet in the morning they wish each
other good appetite. "Smaakelyk leten." In Cairo the inhabitants ask
how do you sweat? for the not sweating is the symptom of an approaching
fever. The Italian and Spaniard ask How does it stand? "Come sta." The
Frenchman, How do you carry yourself? "Comment vous portez vous?" The
German, How do you find yourself? "Wie befinden sie sich." The English,
"How do you do?" The Dutchman says, How fare you. "Hau vaart uwe."
There is one nation (we forget which) which ask "How do you live," and
these are certainly the most wise of all.

_To make starch._--To make starch from wheat, the grain is steeped
in cold water until it becomes soft and yields a milky juice by
pressure; it is then put into sacks of linen, and pressed in a vat
filled with cold water; as long as any milky juice exudes, the pressure
is continued; the fluid gradually becomes clear, and a white powder
subsides, which is starch.

_Chestnut wood_ has recently been successfully applied to the purpose
of dyeing and tanning, thus forming a substitute for log-wood, and
oak bark. Leather tanned by it, is declared by the gentleman who made
the experiments, to be superior to that tanned with oak bark; and in
dyeing, its affinity for wool is said, on the same authority, to be
greater than that of either galls or sumac, and consequently the colour
given more permanent. It also makes admirable ink.

_The ants of Valencia._--M. Humboldt informs, that ants abound to such
a degree near Valencia, that their excavations resemble subterraneous
canals, which are filled with water in the time of the rains, and
become very dangerous to the buildings.

Mr. Heathfield has published a pamphlet, in England, proposing to pay
off one half of the national debt, by an assessment of 15 per cent.
on the capital of all property in the kingdom. The Courier says the
project "is wise, necessary, and will be effectual," and permit the
repeal of twenty millions of taxes.

_Longitude._--La Baronne De Paris Boisrowvray, has arrived in England
from Paris, charged with a commission to present to the Admiralty
Board, a theory of the compass, which gives the longitude and latitude
of the globe, for the discovery of which the whole world has so long
looked. The husband of this lady has submitted his theory to the
Academy at Paris. His wife's mission to London was to prevent delay, as
well as to have a trustworthy agent.

_Indian Jurisprudence._--The Cherokees, it is said, have established
something like a judiciary system, and introduced into their society
many of the laws and usages of civilization. Some of their savage
institutions are disappearing, under the ameliorating influence of
moral justice. As a specimen of the manner in which they dispense
justice in cases of trivial import, we relate the following anecdote,
said to be authentic:

An Indian assaulted another, of which regular information was made.
The judge ordered the sheriff to bring the parties before him. The
sheriff went in pursuit of them, but returned without them. "Where
are your prisoners?" said the judge. "I caught them," replied the
sheriff,--"What did you do with them?" "I gave the defendant fifteen
lashes." "What did you do with the plaintiff?" "Gave him fifteen too."
"What with the informer or witness?" "Why I gave him twenty-five
lashes--for, had he held his tongue, there would have been none of this
fuss and trouble." It would be well if all the dispensations of justice
could be so equally and promptly administered.

                                                     [_Savannah Museum._

_Preservation of Water at Sea._--M. Pernet, after an examination of
the means which are, or may be adopted for the preservation of fresh
water at sea, gives the preference to the following: 1½ parts of oxide
of manganese in powder is mixed with 250 parts of water, and agitated
every fifteen days. In this way water has been preserved unchanged for
seven years.

The editor of the Annales de Chimie observes, that oxide of manganese
has the power, not only of preserving water, but of rendering that
sweet which has become putrid; but he also points out the important
circumstance, that the oxide is slightly soluble in water, and
therefore recommends the use of iron tanks for the water, as in England.

_A species of limestone_ has been discovered in working the canal
through the state of New York, and since in many parts of the country,
so well adapted for water cement as to supercede the necessity
of importing, as heretofore done, at great expense the principal
ingredient of hydraulic mortar.

_Charleston, January 27._--We have seen a specimen of white marble,
recently discovered in Spartenburg district, about five miles from
Broad river. It is acknowledged to be very superior; and its grain is
said to surpass that of the Italian marble.

REMARKS.--It must be highly gratifying to the benevolent mind, and
to those whose humane labours have been so long directed to mitigate
the ravages of Small Pox, to learn, that there has not been a single
case of death, by that disease, reported in this city within the last
year--a disease which has been, for so many ages, a scourge to every
part of the world; and has, at times, been particularly fatal here.

Whilst Consumption and Fever, generally, occupy a considerable space in
the annual returns, it is consolatory to observe, that the former has
not increased: and that Fever, particularly Typhus, so fatal, so wide
spread, and so unyielding to medical skill in Europe, has been much
less malignant in this city the present, than in former years.

It is a singular fact, and perhaps worthy the attention of medical
gentlemen, that more deaths were occasioned by TETANUS or LOCKED JAW,

in the cities of Philadelphia, New York, Baltimore, and Boston, during
the same period, as is shown by the following abstract:--

FOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.


The following trifle was published in one of the earlier numbers of the
Port Folio, when that work was edited by the late JOS. DENNIE; but the
author would be gratified, by seeing it transplanted into the columns
of the _Rural Magazine_.


THE ASPEN TREE.

  Lines written on seeing an Aspen tree, which the venerable owner
    had determined to fell; but observing the initials of the name of
    a much lamented son incised on the bark, he resolved to protect
    it from every assailant.

    Hail! fortunate tree, which has weather'd the blast,
    And 'scaped the blind fury of woodchopper's arm,
    Thy bark was inscribed in times which are past,
    And the favourite letters protect thee from harm:

    For to the fond breast of a father they bring,
    The image how dear! of a promising youth;
    Whose bosom was warm as the noon-tide of spring,
    Whose conduct dictated by virtue and truth:

    But alas! when the summons to sleep with the dead,
    Is signed by the merciless fingers of death,
    Nor virtue, nor truth can its influence shed,
    To detain for a moment the fast ebbing breath.

    His soul from its cerement compelled to depart,
    Winged its way to the regions of bliss and repose,
    And left a loved parent in sorrow of heart,
    To think on his loss, and to tell o'er his woes:

    But though the fond form to his eye may be lost,
    Yet shall dear _mementos_ recall it to mind;
    And the tree which by tempest and storm has been tost,
    Shall with tremulous motion still wave in the wind.
                                                        E.

SONG OF GRATITUDE.

    Who bade to light the morning skies,
    The glorious orb of day to rise?--
    Who first the waves of ocean curl'd,
    And roll'd its waters round the world?--
    Who bade the soil the harvest yield
    And deck'd the flow'rets of the field--
    From Chaos this terrestrial ball
    Call'd into life?----The GOD of all.
    HE, within whose almighty hands
    Humility supported stands,
    Who with his _own_ bestow'd _our_ breath
    And saved us from eternal death.

    To him then let us joyous raise
    The song of gratitude and praise,
    And bless him, that his bounties flow,
    In endless streams to all below;
    And that his boundless grace has given,
    To man--a final rest in heaven.
                                         A.


THE HAMLET,

                        AN ODE BY THOMAS WARTON.

    The hinds how blest who ne'er beguil'd,
    To quit their hamlet's hawthorn wild;
    Nor haunt the crowd, nor tempt the main,
    For splendid care, and guilty gain!

    When morning's twilight tinctur'd beam
    Strikes their low thatch with slanting gleam,
    They rove abroad in ether blue,
    To dip the scythe in fragrant dew;
    The sheaf to bind, the beech to fell,
    That nodding shades a craggy dell.

    'Midst gloomy glades, in warbles clear,
    Wild nature's sweetest notes they hear:
    On green untrodden banks they view
    The hyacinth's neglected hue:
    In their lone haunts, and woodland rounds,
    They spy the squirrel's airy bounds:
    And startle from her ashen spray,
    Across the glen, the screaming jay:
    Each native charm their steps explore
    Of Solitude's sequester'd store.

    For them the moon with cloudless ray
    Mounts, to illume their homeward way.
    Their weary spirits to relieve
    The meadows, incense breathe at eve.
    No riot mars the simple fare,
    That o'er a glimmering hearth they share:
    But when the curfeu's measur'd roar
    Duly, the darkening vallies o'er,
    Has echoed from the distant town,
    They wish no beds of cygnet down,
    No trophied canopies, to close
    Their drooping eyes in quick repose.

    Their little sons, who spread the bloom
    Of health around the clay-built room,
    Or through the primrose coppice stray,
    Or gambol in the new-mown hay;
    Or quaintly braid the cowslip-twine,
    Or drive afield the tardy kine;
    Or hasten from the sultry hill,
    To loitre at the shady rill;
    Or climb the tall pine's gloomy crest,
    To rob the raven's ancient nest.

    Their humble porch with honey'd flow'rs,
    The curling woodbine's shade embow'rs:
    From the small garden's thymy mound,
    Their bees in busy swarms resound;
    Nor fell Disease, before his time,
    Hastes to consume life's golden prime;
    But when their temples long have wore
    The silvan crown of tresses hoar;
    As studious still calm peace to keep,
    Beneath a flowery turf they sleep.


VERSES WRITTEN AFTER SEEING WINDSOR CASTLE.

                      BY THOMAS WARTON THE ELDER.

    From beaut'ous Windsor's high and storied halls,
    Where Edward's chiefs start from the glowing walls,
    To my low cot, from ivory beds of state,
    Pleas'd I return, unenvious of the great.
    So the bee ranges o'er the vary'd scenes
    Of corn, of heaths, of fallows, and of greens;
    Pervade the thicket, soars above the hill,
    Or murmurs to the meadow's murmuring rill;
    Now haunts old hollow'd oaks, deserted cells,
    Now seeks the low vale-lily's silver bells;
    Sips the warm fragrance of the green-house bowers,
    And tastes the myrtle and the citron flowers;
    At length returning to the wonted comb,
    Prefers to all his little straw-built home.


FINLAND SONG.

                  Addressed by a mother to her child.

                             BY DR. LEYDEN.

    Sweet bird of the meadow, oh! soft be thy rest,
    Thy mother will wake thee at morn from thy nest;
    She has made a soft nest, little red-breast for thee,
    Of the leaves of the birch, and the moss of the tree.
    Then soothe thee, sweet bird of my bosom, once more,
    'Tis Sleep, little infant, that stands at the door.
    "Where is the sweet babe?" you may hear how he cries,
    "Where is the sweet babe?" in his cradle that lies;
    "In his cradle, soft swaddled in vestments of down,
    "'Tis mine to watch o'er him till darkness be flown."


QUIET MIND.

    "My mind to me a kingdom is,
      Such perfect joy therein I find,
    As far exceeds all earthly bliss,
      That God or nature hath assign'd:
    Though much I want, that most would have,
    Yet still my mind forbids to crave.

    "Content to live, this is my stay;
      I seek no more than may suffice:
    I press to bear no haughty sway,
      Look, what I lack, _my mind supplies_.
    Lo! thus I triumph like a king,
    Content with what my mind doth bring.

    "I see how plenty surfeits oft,
      And hasty climbers soonest fall,
    I see that such as sit aloft,
      Mishap doth threaten most of all:
    These get with toil, and keep with fear,
    Such cares my mind could never bear.

    "No princely pomp, nor wealthy store,
      No force to win a victory,
    No wily wit to salve a sore,
      No shape to win a lover's eye.
    To none of these I yield as thrall,
    For why? my mind despiseth all.

    "Some have too much, yet still they crave;
      I little have, yet seek no more,
    They are but poor, though much they have,
      And I am rich with little store:
    They poor, I rich; they beg, I give,
    They lack, I lend; they pine, I live.

    "I laugh not at another's loss,
      I grudge not at another's gain;
    No worldly wave my mind can toss,
      I brook what is another's bane;
    I fear no foe, nor fawn no friend,
    I loathe not life, nor dread its end.

    "My wealth is health--and perfect ease,
      My conscience clear, my chief defence:
    I never seek by bribes to please,
      Nor by desert to give offence;
    Thus do I live, thus will I die,
    Would all did so, as well as I.

    "I take no joy in earthly bliss,
      I weigh not Crœsus' wealth a straw;
    For care, I care not what it is,
      I fear not Fortune's fatal law.
    My mind is such as may not move,
    For beauty bright, or force of love.

    "I wish but what I have at will,
      I wander not, to seek for more;
    I like the plain, I climb no hill,
      In greatest storms, I sit on shore;
    And laugh at them who toil in vain,
    To get what must be lost again.

    "I kiss not where I wish to kill,
      I feign not love where most I hate,
    I break no sleep to win my will,
      I wait not at the miser's gate.
    I scorn no poor, I fear no rich,
    I feel no want, nor have too much.

    "The court nor camp I like, nor loathe,
      Extremes are counted worst of all,
    The golden mean between them both,
      Doth surest sit, and fears no fall.
    This is my choice; for why? I find,
    _No wealth is like a quiet mind_."


MOONLIGHT AND CALM AT SEA.

    When every breeze is hush'd to rest,
    And the soft zephyr of the dappled west
                    Its voice does lose;
    When Dian's silver light does sleep,
    O'er the smooth bosom of the deep,
                    How sweet to muse!

    When ocean's swelling bosom bright,
    Seems studded o'er with golden light,
                    Of many a star;
    And the wild sea fowls' harsh shrill strain
    Echoing along th' unruffled main
                    Is heard afar;

    'Tis then each rising care does sleep
    With the soft stillness of the deep,
                    In sympathetic power.
    'Tis then each swelling pulse does thrill,
    And sweetest bliss the heart does fill,
                    In such an hour.

    The soul too fond is soothed to rest;
    By mild serenity possess'd,
                    Nor thinks the storm is nigh;
    But soon the placid scene is o'er,
    And swelling ocean round does roar,
                    Contesting with the sky.

    'Tis thus on life's deceitful tide,
    With placid course we seem to glide,
                    All free from care;
    But soon the too delusive charm,
    Flies fast away with every calm,
                    And prospect fair!

    Then happy they, who list'ning hear,
    The voice that speaks the tempest near.
                    And arms for every ill;
    The whirlwind blast is then disarmed,
    Of many a shaft that would have harm'd
                    And half the storm is still.


GO, IDLE LAYS!

In imitation of Waller's "Go, lovely Rose!"

          Go, idle lays!
    Tell her whose youthful heart beats high
          To future days
    That now so fair in prospect lie,
    How soon our dearest transports die.
          Tell her whose cheek
    The blush of conscious pleasure wears,
          That they who seek
    To find delights unmix'd with cares
    Shall own the fond deceit in tears.
          Say that while charms
    Which Hebe's transient presence lends
          The bosom warms,
    Time's envious breath the canker sends
    That youth's enchanting season ends.
          To her whom health
    With ruddy blushes high illumes,
          Say that by stealth
    Disease to pallid wrinkles dooms,
    The cheek that now so sweetly blooms.
          Tell her whose form
    The partial hand of Beauty gave,
          That from the worm
    Kind Pity's touch shall never save
    The charms that moulder in the grave!
          Go, idle lays!
    Tell her whose youthful heart beats high
          To future days
    That now so fair in prospect lie,
    How soon our dearest transports die!
          Then softly say
    That, when terrestrial joys and pains
          Shall melt away,
    The soul, absolv'd from sensual stains,
    Shall soar where bliss immortal re'gns!

Mrs. Morris, the lady of major Morris, who lately descended in the
diving-bell, at Plymouth, whilst under water, wrote a long letter to
her father, which concluded with the following lines:--

    From a _belle_, my dear father you've oft had a line.
      But not from a _bell_ under water;
    Just now I can only assure you I am thine--
      Your _diving_ affectionate daughter.




TO CORRESPONDENTS.


Of the few essays refused admittance in the _Rural Magazine_, we regret
most, the necessity we apprehend ourselves under of declining to insert
the one on Politics by Lucius. The ability with which it was written,
was not sufficient to overcome our objection to the subject.--We invite
him heartily, as we have heretofore personally done, to our _Evening
Fire Side_, when he may be disposed to amuse or instruct our company on
any suitable subject.

Our other friends, who know they are welcome, we hope will not require
a monthly invitation.
