<p>To that branch of the harmonious
family of Literature, of which the
<span class="smcap">Essayist</span> is a legitimate member,
one peculiar immunity has uniformly
been accorded. He has permission,
at all times, to commune with his
readers, unrestrained by drawing-room
etiquette, and without being
required to appear in full dress. He
can, in this respect, plead immemorial
usage, or literary common law,
as a privileged personage. But, as
neatness of costume and decorous
deportment are never disregarded,
by the well-bred man, in any circumstances;
so, the well-bred writer will
not fail in his observance of neatness
of style, and, what is of infinitely
more importance, correctness of sentiment.
Familiarity, inordinately indulged,
is another name for rudeness.
Motives of the most imperious character,
calculated to prompt him to
such a course of conduct, may be
found, in contemplating the splendid
union of talent and virtue, by which
many of those were distinguished,
who have trodden the same path before
him. They were, alternately
engaged, in culling, from its borders,
flowers variegated with every tint of
beauty, or in gathering the ripest,
most salutary, and most delightful
fruit. Although, on the authority of
Bacon and Roscommon, the author
of the "English Dictionary" has defined
an <span class="smcap">Essay</span> to be "<em>an irregular,
indigested piece</em>," yet there are other
eminent scholars, who, it would appear,
did not consider such a definition
as perfectly correct. <span class="smcap">John
Locke</span>, one of the greatest men, of
whom Great Britain can boast, and
the late Dr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>, of Princeton,
have imparted a degree of dignity to
the term, not in exact accordance
with the generally received acceptation
of its import. These may, however,
be viewed in the light of exceptions
to a general rule. While furnished
with the opportunity, permit
me to dwell for a moment, with some
emphasis, on the meritorious <span class="smcap">Essays</span>
of these celebrated writers. The
philosophy of <span class="smcap">Locke</span> has no affinity,
whatever, with the infidel philosophy
of more recent times. He was a
firm believer in the sublime, and inexpressibly
important, truths of Revelation;
and consequently, a serious
and devout Christian. His analysis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
of mind, and the index he has given
by which to ascertain where its
strength may be profitably exerted,
and where the depths of profundity
present themselves, which its limited
line cannot fathom, are calculated
to teach its true nature and powers.
The perusal of such a work, will necessarily
widen the mental horizon of
every intelligent reader, and, at the
same time, impart a taste for that practical
mode of inquiry which is characterized
by closeness of research. He
advances step by step in his investigations;
you are never solicited to
adopt his conclusions, but they are
made manifest, in the broad and clear
light of truth. Dr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>, a countryman
of our own, was a man of
profound learning, possessing a genius
of the highest order. One reason,
for entertaining a high opinion of
his <span class="smcap">Essay</span> on the causes of the difference
of complexion, &amp;c. in the human
species, shall be stated. We all
have our prejudices; some of which,
viewed through the deceptive medium
of education and habit, are probably
concealed from ourselves.&mdash;Amongst
these prejudices, there are
none, perhaps, stronger or more inveterate,
even in Pennsylvania, than
those which exist against the unfortunate
and injured African. Oh, my
country! thou art madly provoking
the tremendous indignation of Heaven,
by a perilous perseverance in
wrong and injustice!</p>

<div class="poetry-center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And hast thou then no law besides thy will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No just criterion fix'd to good and ill?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Futurity is wisely concealed from our
view; but of this solemn truth there
can be no question,&mdash;<span class="smcap">VICE</span> and <span class="smcap">OPPRESSION</span>
<em>will not always go unpunished</em>.
Almost unconscious of it, the
unjust bias, above alluded to, had in
some degree taken possession of my
mind; but was, it is hoped, almost entirely
removed, by an attentive and
thorough examination of his doctrines.
He, as well as <span class="smcap">Locke</span>, contemplates
true philosophy in the elevated
character of a hand-maid to
Revelation. One of his leading objects
is, to establish, by a course of
fair and manly reasoning, the veracity
of the Mosaic account of the creation.</p>

<p>When I sat down at my desk, I had
intended to consult a few of the pages
of our early history, for the purpose
of finding some profitable lessons for
the instruction of the present generation;
but, by indulging a <em>desultory</em>
propensity, the original purpose has
almost been lost sight of. The salutary
effect, which results from frequently
ascending to first principles,
has been long known and acknowledged.
There is many a prodigal
spendthrift among us, who would do
well, in various respects, to imitate
the example of his industrious and
unostentatious ancestor, from whom
he has inherited the means of indulging
his extravagant desires. He
should remember, that the highest
privilege of wealth is to aid the meritorious
who stand in need of assistance;
and that industry, properly directed,
does, even to the man whose
necessities do not require such exertion,
always bring with it an ample reward.
"Health and length of days
are in her right hand, and in her left
riches and honour!"</p>

<p>The corner stone of this Commonwealth
was laid in immutable justice;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
and the hands of her founders were
never stained by the blood of an Indian.
Our primitive annals, therefore,
solicit, and will endure, the closest
and most rigid scrutiny. The
first settlers were plain in their habits,
and simple in their manners. They
laboured indefatigably with their own
hands, and their lives were distinguished
by pure morals, and unaffected
piety. The blessing of Providence
followed them; and their
descendants have become a great
people. But how long will this
prosperity last, should their maxims
of economy, simplicity, and temperance,
continue to be utterly disregarded?
Necessity, it is believed, is
at the present time, teaching some of
them with effect. <span class="smcap">William Penn</span>,
whose amiable and great qualities
furnish an opulent subject, on which,
if the narrowness of my page did
not forbid, I should delight to dwell,
was one of those bright luminaries
which, at distant intervals, have cheered
and irradiated a benighted world.</p>

<span class="i0">Thus lovely halcyons dive into the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then show far off their shining plumes again.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In conclusion, permit me to relate
an anecdote of the great lawgiver,
which is traditional, it is true, but, at
the same time, direct and authentic.
Being on a visit at the house of one of
his friends, who resided at <span class="smcap">Gwynedd</span>,
a Welch settlement, twenty miles
from Philadelphia, he remained there
during the night. When shown into
his chamber, in which there was a
considerable quantity of grain, apologies
were made to him, and regrets
expressed, that no better accommodations
could be furnished, on such
an occasion. With that urbanity and
goodness of heart, for which he was
so remarkable, he immediately put to
rest every anxiety, which had previously
existed, by a single observation:
"<em>I do not wish to see more appropriate
furniture in a new settlement;
nothing could give me more pleasure.</em>"
It should not be forgotten,
that <span class="smcap">Penn</span> could number among his
<em>intimate</em> friends, many of the English
nobility and gentry; and had stood,
with no infrequency, in the presence
of princes, but still his humility and
unassuming manners were unimpaired.</p>

<p>There is no faculty of the mind,
of which man is more proud, than of
<span class="smcap">REASON</span>. It is this which most strikingly
distinguishes him from the
brute creation, to which he owes his
empire over the elements, and by
which he dares ever to explore the
councils of the Deity. The triumphs
of reason, however, have
chiefly been in the fields of philosophy,
and amidst the stillness of
solitude, "in regions mild of calm
and serene air." In the ordinary
pursuits of life, her voice is drowned
amidst the clamour of contending
passions; and every successive generation
of mankind, has to travel over
the same course of inexperience and
presumption, of error and misconduct,
of remorse and repentance.
The triumphs of reason in philosophy
endure from age to age, and are
not only glorious in themselves, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the means of acquiring new conquests.
Those victories, which she
obtains over the passions, are confined
to the lives, and written in the experience,
of individuals. The truths,
which it required the utmost capacity
of the human intellect to develope,
are now familiar to the apprehension
of every school-boy: but human nature
continues to be as prone to evil,
as selfish and untoward, as if the divine
Author of our religion had never
walked on earth. There is, in
this view of the subject, much that
may humble the most aspiring intellect.
It shows, that the greatest genius
affords no exemption from the
ordinary weaknesses and vices of our
nature, and that the mere force of
reason cannot destroy the propensities
which for ever drag us down to
earth.</p>

<p>Even in those pursuits which are
purely abstract, the different degrees
of intellect approximate more nearly
to each other than we commonly
imagine. There are certain brilliant
talents which we are apt to regard
with a kind of superstitious feeling,
and which we suppose to be gifted
with an almost intuitive knowledge.
Yet, the truth is, that those qualities
which most easily attract the vulgar
gaze, are fallacious and superficial.
The highest and most lasting rewards
of fame, have been earned by slow
and patient labour; while the more
dazzling career of genius has often
terminated in disappointment and obscurity.
He who trusts to the mere
force and splendour of his talents, will
find that they cannot sustain his flight,
and that the most brilliant inventions
of the human mind fade before the
realities of nature; that there is no
real glory in philosophy, separate
from that of truth, and no key which
will unlock her treasures, save that
of patient investigation. There can
be no discipline, better fitted to humble
the pride and silence the vanity
of man, than that of the inductive
philosophy; for it teaches him that
the only disposition of mind, in which
he can acquire substantial knowledge,
is that of docility to the voice of experience;
and that patience and humility
are far more valuable and efficient
in a philosopher, than the brightest
genius. When Newton commenced
the researches that conducted him
to an eminence, which no other mortal
has attained, it was by careful and
unprejudiced observation. He suffered
no previous opinion to mislead
his judgment, no weak ambition to
disturb his mind; but watched, with
untiring patience, for the illuminations
of truth. It was, probably, to
this careful exclusion of prejudice
and vanity, as much as to any other
cause, that he owed his wonderful
achievements; for they must have
been attained by regular advances,
by steps which the meanest understanding
is capable of following.</p>

<p>If these remarks are correct as
regards philosophical, they are more
strikingly so in relation to moral
truth. The fabric of philosophy is
the work of ages, and its dimensions
are as capacious as those of nature;
but the edifice of moral truth can be
perfected in the sphere of action, and
during the life of every individual.
Its foundation is laid by the hand of
the Creator in the heart of every intelligent
being, and is spoken of in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Scripture, as the rock on which the
wise man built, and under the type
of a light which has enlightened every
man, of a word which is nigh us in
our heart and in our mouth. This
light may be darkened by superstition,
distorted by prejudice, or buried
beneath the cumbrous systems of a
false philosophy; but can never be
totally extinguished. He who would
follow its illuminations, and become
the votary of truth, must separate
himself from these troubled elements
of life. He must listen in quiet seclusion
to her voice, and acquire, by
humble and patient watchfulness, that
habitual mastery over his mind, which
is the groundwork, and the only foundation,
of permanent excellence; and
thus will he gradually come to know
the truth as it is.</p>

<p>He who thinks to hear her still and
small voice amidst the agitations of
contending passions, will find himself
deaf to its monitions. In our intercourse
with the world, and our chase
of its glittering phantoms, our interests
and desires continually mislead
us. We follow their guidance, rather
than that of truth; we hurry
down the stream of pleasure and business,
and make our reason itself the
slave of our appetites. There is
something in the alternations of hope
and fear, in the longings of ambition,
and the first flushes of success, that
engrosses and fills the mind. But
when the zeal, with which we followed
some object of unworthy ambition,
is spent; when the violence of passion
is exhausted, and satiety has succeeded
to enjoyment, we sink down
into the bitterness of self-reproach
and remorse. We then perceive
how fatally we have wandered from
the path of reason, and determine,
while our passions are spent and
asleep, to chain them at her feet.
Alas! they will awake, like the tiger
from his lair, with the scent of
blood in his nostrils, more furious and
more powerful from every success.</p>

<p>These loose and general remarks
may serve to illustrate the admirable
economy of Providence. The truths,
which it is important for us to know,
are easily comprehended. Those qualities,
by the possession of which the
great end of our being is to be answered,
are within the attainment of every
rational creature. By a wonderful
law of equality, the difference which
appears to exist between different orders
of intellect, is scarcely sensible
in its effects upon the happiness and
virtue of individuals. Brilliant talents,
and rare accomplishments, do
but expose their owner to more dangerous
and subtle temptations, and
too often furnish the weapon which
destroys the peace of their possessor;
while humbler virtues pass along,
unconscious of these self-inflicted
tortures. The latter pursue, from
instinct and choice, that path of humble
and quiet action, which the former
will find, after all his wanderings,
to be the only one that leads to
peace, and is lighted by the pure and
unwavering radiance of truth.</p>

his seed to the earth, conscious
of having done all within his power,
rests in the goodness of <span class="smcap">Him</span> who rules
these lower elements, for the completion
of the work. The white
mantle of Nature is thrown over the
germs of future sustenance, by the
genial breath of Spring; "the early
and the latter rains," and the vivifying
heat of the sun, awaken those germs
into beauty, clothe them with luxuriance,
and ripen them for the sickle.
But the husbandman well knows,
that unless he be careful to select
seed of the proper kind, and weight
and purity, the product, he will reap,
will deteriorate in its nature. However
good the soil may be, his granary
will receive a value proportioned
only to his attention to the maxim&mdash;<em>Take
care what you sow.</em></p>

<p>But there are <span class="smcap">SEEDS</span>, whose value is
infinitely greater than wheat, or rye,
or barley. Give me your ears, ye honest
hearts of our rich farms, ye independent
men of our beautiful vallies,
and let me caution you to <em>take
care how you sow</em>!</p>

<p>It is recorded, with great truth,
that "books, men and things are
lying constantly in wait to deceive
souls, and bring them to perdition:"
and books are here very correctly
placed first on the list of deceivers.
They are more dangerous, because
less suspected; and the <em>seeds</em>, which
are sown, by pernicious volumes, in
the minds of the young and inexperienced,
in the silence of solitude,
take very deep root, and bring forth
fruits of vice and corruption. O! how
the spirit of genuine sensibility laments
the widely spreading evils,
which cast desolation over <em>fields of
beauty!</em> Beware! ye noble-minded
yeomen, how you admit into your
little libraries, these insidious seducers,
these <em>tares</em>, which grow amidst
the tender plants which the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of
the heritage has deposited in the soil
he loves, and committed to your
charge. It is in your power to aid
the growth of the germs of goodness
and piety, which may flourish under
your fostering care, by the blessing
of the great Husbandman, and make
your children the glory of our country!
Aim, therefore, at a judicious
selection, that the <em>seeds</em> you sow may
not want either weight or purity;
and then "the early and the latter
rain," which descend <em>from above</em>,
will mature them into strength and
loveliness.</p>

<p>This caution is also peculiarly applicable
to those who have the direction
of the numerous village libraries,
that have latterly arisen in our
favoured land. On these men, an awful
responsibility rests. They have,
in their hands, the future characters
of the people, who may live in their
respective neighbourhoods. They
have, under their care, <em>the destinies
of an unborn race</em>! The <em>seeds</em>, which
are now sown in the hearts of the
young, will, when they shall become
parents, be transmitted to other soils.
What an incalculable magnitude and
importance invest this subject! Let
them beware, therefore, as they shall
answer at a high tribunal. "Take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
care,"&mdash;said a monitor to the celebrated
statuary, <span class="smcap">Bacon</span>, as he tapped him
on the shoulder,&mdash;"remember, you
are working for posterity!"&mdash;and the
caution was reciprocated to the divine.
<em>Take care</em>, says the Plough-Boy,
to the directors of village libraries,
<em>what you sow</em>!</p>

<p>Many a lovely damsel, whose rosy
cheeks and sparkling eyes once indicated
the sweetness and the purity of
innocence, has had her heart tarnished,
corrupted, ruined, by the insidious
poison of books,&mdash;books read in
secret, remote from the vigilant eye
of a tender parent or kind friend.
Into the recesses of the solitude of
these; yes, even at the hour when
the remainder of the family is reposing
in peace, and when the rays of
the midnight lamp are thrown on the
idle, the romantic, or vicious page,
let the warning voice of the Plough-Boy
enter. May his accents thunder
in their ears, <em>Take care how you
sow</em>!</p>

<p>The vast increase of <em>taverns</em>, in
our country and villages, calls us to
beware of <em>men</em>, as well as of books.
There is a great difference, my father
tells me, between the simplicity
of manners, which characterized the
times when he was a boy, and the
idleness and dissipation which have
now spread over the country. Then
it was considered a <em>disgrace</em>, to a
young farmer, to be seen at a tavern,
excepting when absolute necessity
called him thither. Now, visit one
of these seductive inns, in an afternoon,
and we can see a band of hardy
striplings, smoking their segars,
drinking their cans of beer, or tossing
off their glasses of "real Holland,"
and permitting their minds to
be agitated by the evanescent politics
of the day, while their families are
either ignorant of their habits, or
mourning over the tares, which the
enemy is sowing in a fruitful field.
Alas! even in his time, the Plough-Boy
has witnessed the robust young
husbandman, graced with an athletic
form, adorned with vivid health and
manly beauty, and blessed with a
lovely wife and innocent prattlers,
sink into an early grave, opened by
Infamy and closed by Despair, solely
in consequence,&mdash;first, of suffering
his mind to be led aside from his business
by the solicitations of idle men,
and losing his precious time at the
tavern; and then, of "just taking a
social glass," which they have told
him it would be unmanly to refuse.</p>

<p>Beware, my youthful companions,
of these <em>first</em>, and apparently insignificant
steps in idleness. No man suddenly
becomes wicked. The power
of habit is enlisted on the side of virtue,
until its barrier be broken down
by repeated <em>small</em> attacks; and he,
who in former times could indignantly
exclaim, "Is thy servant a <em>dog</em>,
that he would do this thing?" yet
committed the very evils at which an
exalted spirit had shuddered with terror.
<em>Take care</em>, ye young noblemen
of Nature! <em>how you sow</em>.</p>

<p>Various other incitements are widely
spread through our country, to lead
men to sow seeds of vice and ignominy
in their fields. It becomes not
the Plough-Boy to enter too much
into detail. The evils are abroad,
and walking their desolating course;
and he who can, in the hour of solitude,
yield his mind to the dominion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
of reflection, will be at no loss to discover
the peculiar inducements to
idleness or dissoluteness, in his own
vicinity. To all, therefore, who value
the <em>seeds of immortal beauty</em>,
let the warning voice of the Plough-Boy
of the valley, reach with effect;
and the gentle salutation of the morning
ray, which visited his own spirit,
may not have been sent without an instructive
purpose. To all, this lesson
is deeply interesting; for the happiness
of the long, long ages of eternity,
depends upon it. "Whatsoever
a man shall sow, that will he reap.
If ye sow to the flesh, ye shall reap
corruption; but if to the spirit, the
life which is eternal."</p>

"IS IT PEACE, JEHU?"</h2>


<p>The evanescent sorrows of infancy
have faded from the recollection, the
flowery scenes of childhood are passed,
the thraldom of pupilage is over,
the fetters of minority are dissevered,
and Youth steps boldly on the
threshold of life, proud of the superiority,
and conscious of the attributes
of <span class="smcap">MAN</span>.</p>

<p class="center">"The world is all before him where to choose."</p>

<p>Society courts him to the enjoyment
of rational and of sensual pleasure.
The anticipation of evil finds no place
in his imagination. All of friendship
is faithful, and love pure as attractive.
A short career in the busy
round of existence, while it proves
the fallacy of some of his crude conceptions,
only affords a confirmation
of others. If trusted friendship discover
its instability, or cherished love
its inconstancy, still Fancy promises,
in other fountains, the unadulterated
source of happiness. He looks not
to the mind to supply the vacuum
they have left. Youth is not the season
for reflection. Fame has not yet
animated the daring spirit of enterprise,
and the social circle and the
midnight revel display all their attractions.
Lost in the whirl of inebriating
delights, Reason maintains but
a divided empire. But let her "still
small voice" be heard in the intervals
of passion, and will it not whisper to
his heart, <em>Is it peace?</em></p>

<p>The bowl has ceased to exhilarate;
this species of excitement is happily
relinquished, and, in the active scenes
of business, he finds a stimulant to exertion
and enjoyment. The acquisition
of wealth will enable him to astonish
the world with his magnificence;
or, if a more worthy motive
prevail, will furnish the means to relieve
indigence, extricate virtuous
misfortune from the fetters that chain
it to the earth, and wipe the tear of
want from the eye of the widow and
the orphan. Glorious reward for days
of toilsome industry. How soon may
he find some more sordid spirit grasping
the object that eludes his pursuit,
and the anguish of disappointment
displace the glowing visions of his
fancy. While the strife of hopes and
fears drive repose from his pillow,
when the howling of the wind reminds
him of the instability of that
element on which he has adventured
many a <em>rich argosie</em>, it would be
mockery for him to ask of Care, <em>Is
it peace?</em></p>

<p>Fortune, however, while she laughed
to scorn his dreams of princely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
splendour, has deigned to crown his
days of anxiety with competence,
and Philosophy bids him be content.
He chooses a partner of his joys and
sorrows, and sees a hopeful progeny
around him. Once more Fancy
spreads the glowing landscape of the
future to his eye. Through those
dear ones, whose infantine pleasures
now amuse his paternal mind, he will
attain the object of his hopes. His
daughters shall wed with the first families
that now tower above him;
his sons&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"Visions of glory spare his aking sight;"&mdash;
</p>

<p>he eagerly anticipates the moment of
their matured existence, when he
shall exultingly exclaim, in the fulness
of his heart, after the detail of
their unrivalled achievements, I <span class="smcap">AM
THEIR FATHER</span>. A few years roll
away; the fiat of Omniscience is
gone forth, and all, but one, of those
that but now cheered his domestic
board, are gathered into the garner
of eternity. That one, the first&mdash;the
last&mdash;remains his only comfort. On
that loved one, he, and the beloved
partner of his afflictions, bowed down
with sorrow rather than with years,
now place their only hopes. He will
support their tottering footsteps; he
sooth the sorrows and smooth the
pillow of their waning age. Alas!
the haunts of dissipation receive him;
premature infirmities, racking pains,
palsied limbs, hasten him, with rapid
and unerring steps, to the grave&mdash;and
all beyond it. It were in vain to ask
of his agonized bosom,&mdash;agonized by
the conviction of his fatal paternal
indulgence,&mdash;<em>Is it peace!</em></p>

<p>Is not the quiver of affliction exhausted?
One shaft is left. That
dear mourner, that has partaken so
largely of the cup of his sorrows, cannot
sustain the recollection</p>

<p class="center">"That such things were, and were most dear to her."
</p>

<p>Silent and uncomplaining, she bows
before the storm. Her ashes rest
with those of her children. Where
is now that eager spirit, grasping at
phantoms, and soaring into the regions
of uncreated imagination. Hope
is extinguished in his bosom; his soul
is black with the very midnight of
despair. Frail man! Didst thou ever
ask, <em>Of whom did I receive these precious
gifts?</em> Bow before the throne
of Omnipotence; bless that Power
who gave and who took away; pray
to him for resignation; and, when the
spirit of vital religion pours its holy
influence into thy heart, thou needest
not ask of thyself or the world, <em>Is it
peace?</em></p>

<p>If the form of government with
which we are blessed, is to be durable,
it will depend upon the <em>virtue
and intelligence of the people</em>. Ignorance
and vice cannot sustain a republican
system. It becomes, therefore,
a duty of the highest order, to
spread practical learning over every
mind, and cultivate piety in every
heart. To do this, the establishment
of good schools, on the plan suggested
in my last letter, is of great importance.
But other means are also
to be employed. Parents, guardians,
and masters, should discharge their
duty toward those who are entrusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
to their care, by judicious advice and
good example, for the conduct of
life. The domestic circle ought to be
regarded as a <em>moral garden</em>, under
the especial care of the head of every
family. Here he may plant good
seed, and this he is bound to protect
from all pernicious weeds. Let him
therefore frequently examine the premises;
he cannot be too assiduous, and
vigilant. In this particular department,
more is to be accomplished,
than many are disposed to admit. And
if ever our condition as a people is
improved, in the degree to which it is
susceptible, it will owe much to judicious
<em>family discipline</em>. In the city,
as well as in the country, we have
been too relax in the performance of
these manifest obligations. Private
happiness and the public welfare are
intimately connected with the minute
government, and careful training, of
the minds of youth.</p>

<p>Among other auxiliaries, I would
take the liberty to recommend the
establishment of libraries, to be composed
of useful books. These might
be located in the school-houses of
each neighbourhood, and the teacher
should be appointed to the care of the
establishment. In the country, it is
customary to assemble but once, in
the day assigned, for social worship;
in the afternoon of that day, the library
might be opened for the delivery
and reception of books. How
much better would it be, to witness the
people passing, in an orderly manner,
to, and from the library of the vicinage,
than assembling at taverns, or
employed in idle and pernicious
sports, on the evening of a day, set
apart by Christian professors, for the
worship, which is publicly due <em>to
the Sovereign of the world</em>!</p>

<p>You may suppose, fellow citizens,
that these suggestions are the offspring
of a visionary brain; but the
period is coming, with no tardy step,
when sound morals and undefiled religion
will be found to be the best estate.
Men and governments prosper
solely in proportion as they are regulated
by principles which <span class="smcap">God</span> approves.
It is idle, in the last degree,
to expect prosperity from any other
source. All history, sacred and civil,
teaches but one lesson; <span class="smcap">VICE AND

SECT. II.<br />

Of the actual state of Agriculture in Europe.</h2>


<p>8. <em>Holland</em>, though essentially commercial
has, from causes rarely occurring,
become also highly agricultural.
To the descendants of Dutchmen,
the following description of her
industry, in this respect, cannot but
be acceptable. It is from the pen
of an excellent judge and faithful
narrator.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> M. Yoarst, professor of agriculture at
Elfort. See his introductory address to
his class, in 1806.</p></div>

<p>"Their rotation of crops, always
begins with the culture either of
some leguminous plant or profitable
root, and generally with the potato,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>as the best preparative of the ground.
Whatever may be the grain which
follows, whether wheat, rye, &amp;c. &amp;c.
it is generally sown with <em>red clover</em>;
and where it is not, the stubble is
ploughed in immediately after harvest,
and a crop of turnips taken and
either consumed on the ground or
housed for the winter. A single department
(that of Zealand) obtains
by the culture of madder alone, an
annual profit of six millions of florins;
while that of Brabant boasts its
twenty thousand bee-hives; in a word,
this commendable nation, upon an
extent of surface not exceeding seventeen
hundred square leagues, (the
greater part of which has been redeemed
from the ocean) counts two
hundred and forty-three thousand
horses, seven hundred and sixty thousand
horn cattle, about a million of
sheep, from ten to twelve thousand
goats, four hundred and eighty-nine
thousand hogs, and about three millions
of poultry, of every species.
Their stock of manure is necessarily
great, and is both well understood
and well managed."</p>

<p>9. The same causes, physical and
moral, operate against the existence
of a productive agriculture in <em>Denmark</em>
and <em>Sweden</em>&mdash;severity of climate,
poverty of soil, and vassalage
of tenants.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;Their resources are also
alike, and exist principally in
manufactures and commerce, and in
mines, forests and fisheries. The former
boasts fine pasturage and cattle,
in Holstein.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> To give to despotism the air of freedom,
the <em>serfs of the crown</em> were liberated
at the revolution&mdash;but the example was
neither approved nor followed.</p></div>

<p>10. Under the common name of
Germany, we include Prussia, Saxony,
Austria, Wurtemburg, and Bavaria,
and shall say a few words of
each, calculated to give a general
idea of their husbandry. It was not
to be expected that the great Frederick
of <em>Prussia</em> (so devoted to national
glory and strength) would
disregard the interest of agriculture;
and the less so, as in theory
he considered it "<i lang="fr">Les mamelles de
l'elat</i>." We accordingly find him
employed in draining marshes of
great extent,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in filling them with industrious
colonists, and in converting
barren sands into fertile fields, by
placing his capital in the midst of
them. But amongst these good
works, he forgot that the <em>hands of
the labourer, to be efficient, must be
free</em>; he found the peasants slaves,
and left them such.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> In the <em>Dollart</em> what was lost by the
sea was regained, and the marshes on the
<em>Netz</em> and the <em>Warth</em> at <em>Friedburg</em> and in
<em>Pomerania</em> were drained, and the country
rendered habitable.</p></div>

<p>The <em>Saxon</em> peasant, on the other
hand is <em>free</em> and protected by the
law; he holds his farm on lease,
which he sells or transmits to his children
at will: and <em>this</em> is the principal
cause of the flourishing state of
Saxon agriculture. In Lusatia, a
different legislation produces different
effects; but for some years past,
the government and great proprietors
have concurred in changing the <em>vassalage</em>
of the peasants into a <em>mild</em> and
<em>salutary dependence</em>. Saxony is remarkable
for its grain products,
and Lusatia for its stock&mdash;the latter
counts four hundred thousand head
of sheep of the merino race.</p>

<p>Geographers give to <em>Austria</em> and
her dependencies 1965 leagues in circumference.
In a surface like this,
there is necessarily a great variety,
as well of climate as of soil; but in
general, both are favourable to agriculture.
"In the districts of the
Inn, of Lower Stira, of Istria, and of
Carniola, the land is of good quality,
well cultivated and very productive.
In the last, they have two crops in
the year; sowing buck-wheat on
wheat or rye stubble, and millet on
that of hemp and flax.&mdash;They every
where cultivate Indian corn, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>Styria (as in Virginia) it forms the
ordinary bread of the country." In
Bohemia, Moravia, and Galitia,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
the soil is uncommonly rich, and under
proper management would be
very productive. Austrian Silesia is
less fitted for the production of grain,
but excels in forage and cattle.
Hungary, Transylvania and Croatia,
abound in every species of agricultural
produce. Their flocks and pasturage
are not inferior to those of the
Ukraine; and wheat, buck-wheat,
Indian corn, millet, rice, hemp, flax
and tobacco, yield immense harvests
to very small degrees of labour. Yet
is agriculture far from being in a
flourishing condition!&mdash;Writers on
political economy ascribe this fact
principally to two causes&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. The degradation and oppression
of the labouring part of the
community; and</p>

<p>2d. The want of convenient commercial
outlets for the produce of
the soil.</p>

<p>We shall find in Hungary a striking
illustration of the correctness of
this opinion. "The <i lang="la">Populus Hungaricus</i>,"
is divided into four estates,
the magnates, the nobles, and the clergy,
who possess all the lands, and
the "<i lang="la">misera contribuens plebs</i>," who
(besides tithes, rents and corvees)
pay all the taxes. This wretched
populace is composed of the burghers
and the peasantry, of which there
are three kinds&mdash;<em>slaves for life, temporary
slaves</em>, and a third sort called
<i lang="la">liberæ emigrationis</i>, who, as their
name indicates, have loco motive powers
and rights. Of the condition of this
people, since the year 1764, (and before
that period it was much worse)
we may form an idea from the edict
of Maria Theresa, called the <em>urbarium</em>,
or law of contracts between
landlord and tenant, by which it is
declared, that corporal punishment
(inflicted by the master for insolent
words or conduct) shall not exceed
twenty-four strokes with a cane for a
man, and the same number with a
switch for a woman. Nor is the <em>commercial</em>
condition of this people better
than the <em>civil</em>; they are not only
obliged to take from Austria many
things which they could have had in
other places of a better quality and
at a lower price, but they are also
compelled to carry to Vienna the
products of their own soil and labour,
where their sale is embarrassed
and their value lessened by heavy
and oppressive taxes. The same remark
applies to Galitia, whose natural
outlet is the Vistula, or the Nieper;
but of these she is not permitted
to avail herself, and, like her sister
kingdoms, is compelled to seek
the markets furnished by the Danube
and Trieste. "The consequences
are obvious&mdash;the tenant works only
to satisfy hunger, and the landlord is
satisfied with little more than '<i lang="la">victum
et vestitum</i>.'"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The amount of lands annually cultivated
in <em>Bavaria</em>, is one million one
hundred and sixty-five thousand acres,
which produce about six millions of
bushels of grain, of which two millions
are surplus. The Palatinate,
(one of the dependencies of Bavaria)
is also very productive. The route
between Heidelberg and D'Armstadt,
called the <em>Bergstrass</em>, traverses
one of the finest districts of Germany,
and perhaps of Europe; where
are seen extensive vineyards, vast
meadows and fertile fields, producing
wheat, barley, tobacco, madder, rhubarb,
turnips, &amp;c. &amp;c. In the year
1799, all the electorial possessions
within the circle of Bavaria, contained
199,000 horses, 160,000 oxen,
465,000 cows, 961,000 sheep, 320,000
hogs, and 378,000 goats. Yet are
the Bavarians, compared with the inhabitants
of the north of Germany,
half a century in the rear. The
people are, extremely ignorant and
fantastical: like the people of Rome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>and Lisbon, they sacrifice much time
to processions and fetes, and like
them also are slaves of the vilest appetites.

most fertile and well cultivated countries
of Germany. The mountainous
parts produce potatoes, oats, hemp
and flax; the less hilly abound in
wheat, spelts, rye, buck-wheat, Indian
corn and barley; and in the vallies
we find tobacco, madder and
vineyards, in which the grapes of
France, Cyprus, and Persia succeed
perfectly. Apples, pears, &amp;c. are of

<p>11. It has been justly remarked,
that to know the state of husbandry
in any country, you have but to examine
the <em>instruments</em> employed, the
<em>succession</em> of <em>crops</em>, and the <em>condition</em>
of <em>labourers</em>.&mdash;Tried by these tests,
the agriculture of <em>Russia</em> will be
found to be in a state of great degradation.&mdash;The
plough (called <em>soka</em>)
which is commonly used, is very
light, of simple construction, and but
calculated to enter the ground <em>one
inch and a half</em>; the <em>harrow</em> consists
of one or more young pine trees
(whose branches are cut off about
eight inches from the stem) steeped
in water to add to their weight, and
tied together. With such miserable
instruments, each drawn by a single
horse, the farmer scratches the
ground, and without always covering
the seed, which is no doubt the reason
that in dry seasons their harvests
are very bad.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> In the best soil their
<em>succession</em> of <em>crops</em> is of <em>eight years</em>&mdash;two
in barley, two in oats, two in winter
rye, and two in spring rye. Lands of
less fertility are sown <em>two</em> years out
of <em>three</em>, and mountainous tracts one
year in three, when they are abandoned
to weeds, until rest shall have reinstated
them. "To manure them
would, in the opinion of a Russian
peasant, make them poorer;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and
therefore he suffers his dunghill to
accumulate into a nuisance, while he
goes on to clear and exhaust new
fields." "The grains raised are rye,
spelts, barley, millet and oats, which,
from want of sufficient roads and
markets, are often low priced; as
are horned cattle and horses: an ox
selling for a ruble and a half, a cow
for one ruble, and a horse for three
rubles."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> To this wretchedness we
must add, (what perhaps occasions
much of it) that throughout the <em>civilized</em>
part of Russia, the labours of
agriculture are performed by <em>slaves</em>
confounded with the soil, and bought
and sold with it. In a great portion
of the northern section of this vast
empire, agriculture is unknown; and
the chase, the fisheries, cattle and
rein-deer, furnish the only means of
subsistence.</p>

<em>On a Rotation of Crops, and the
most profitable mode of collecting,
preserving and applying
Manures.</em></h2>

<p class="center">(Communicated to the Albany County Agricultural
Society.)</p>

<p class="center">[<span class="smcap">CONCLUDED.</span>]</p>


<p>Of manures which may be termed
fossils we will mention the various
kinds of calcareous substances, the
stony matter called pyrites, coal, salt,
peaty substances, silicious and aluminous
earths. Limestone, gypsum,
chalk and marle, are the calcareous
substances we shall notice, and each
in their order.</p>

<p>Limestone, (carbonate of lime,) has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>always more or less aluminous or silicious
earth in its composition. Frequently
also it contains magnesia.
Limestone of this latter description,
when calcined, makes what the English
farmers call <em>hot</em> lime, which is
more powerful in its effects, and
therefore less of it should be applied
at once to the soil. That without
any mixture of magnesia is considered
more durable in its operation, but
less powerful. Magnesian limestone
is known by its effervescing but little
when plunged in nitric or other
acid, while limestone that is not magnesian,
when thus immersed produces
a strong effervescence. The
magnesian, also, when immersed in
diluted nitric acid, or aqua fortis,
renders the liquid of a milky appearance.
It is usually of a brownish or
pale yellow colour. Being more
caustic when calcined, than common
limestone, it is more efficacious in
decomposing peaty earths, and is best
adapted for soils which have too much
either of peaty or vegetable matter
in them.&mdash;&mdash;Where lands have been
injured by too plentiful an application
of this lime, peaty earth should
be applied to them to correct the
evil.</p>

<p>The trials of lime in this country
have been quite limited, and confined
mostly to the middle states, particularly
Pennsylvania. It has usually
been applied there at the rate of
about forty bushels to the acre; but
whether the lime used there is magnesian,
we have never understood.
Lime may be applied as a top dressing
or mixed with the soil. Its application
has been found most successful
when the first succeeding
crop was Indian corn; afterwards
wheat is grown to advantage. Instances
are mentioned in the memoirs
of the agricultural society of
Philadelphia, where gypsum had no
effect on worn out lands till they
were first manured with lime.</p>

<p>British writers say that lime may
be applied with equal advantage either
when newly slaked or afterwards,
that its effects are not always the same
particularly where soils are different,
but that usually it is a very durable
manure. A much larger quantity
is, however, applied in Great Britain
than has been usual here; but
perhaps the coolness of the summers
there renders more requisite. We
pretend to advise to no particular
rules in the application of lime in this
country, farther than that about forty
bushels to the acre be first tried;
but less for sandy soils, and perhaps
more for those which are stiff
clays would be advisable. In clays
of this description, lime is particularly
useful in destroying the adhesive
quality of such soils, and thereby
rendering them a more friable
loam. Such has been its effects on
the clay lands which abound so much
in England. Where the lime is magnesian,
let trials be made of about
twenty bushels to the acre.</p>

<p>That country abounds much in
the calcareous matter denominated
chalk, which is also converted into
lime by calcination, and used as a
manure. It forms a weaker sort of
lime. As this substance, however,
is hardly to be found in this country,
it will be unnecessary further to
speak of this manure.</p>

<p>Gypsum, (sulphate of lime) is a
most powerful stimulant to the
growth of many crops in all dry soils
in this country, but with the following
exceptions: it has no sensible effect
on lands newly cleared, on those
in the vicinity of the ocean, nor on
those which have been completely
exhausted by severe cropping. In
soils of this latter description, some
pabulous matter must be given them
for the gypsum to digest or act upon;
and this may be a previous manuring
with lime, marl, bog-earth,
barn dung, or perhaps any substance
that is calculated to improve the condition
of the soil. It should also be
observed that the application of gypsum
frequently fails entirely of produ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>cing
its effects if followed by uncommon
drought, or unusually wet weather.
It is generally most powerful
when applied to growths of leguminous
plants, to those extending in
vines, such as the various species of
the gourd tribe, the strawberry, &amp;c.
and to several sorts of the green
crops, particularly potatoes, clover-grasses,
lucern, &amp;c. On fibrous rooted
grasses, and those grain plants
most nearly related to them, such as
wheat, rye, oats, barley, &amp;c. it has
no sensible effect when applied as a
top dressing to the growing plants.
On Buckwheat it is very powerful,
and for Indian corn it is also valuable.
Judge Peters, (of Penn.)
whose experience of its uses has been
long and extensive, says that although
he has found this manure of little
use to many sorts of plants, when applied
to them as a top dressing, yet
he has invariably found that all plants
derive benefit from their seeds being
rolled in gypsum, after being soaked
in some liquid, before sowing or
planting. As a manure, however,
for wheat or grain crops of similar
kinds, immense benefit may be derived
from it by applying it to the sward,
as a top dressing, a suitable length of
time before the ground is broken up.
In this way two bushels of gypsum
may be made to give an additional
increase of eight or ten bushels of
wheat to the acre. Take, for instance,
land which in its natural state,
and with the usual culture, will only
yield ten bushels of wheat to the acre;
in the fall or early in the spring, give
it a top dressing of two bushels of
gypsum to the acre; by the middle of
June following, the land will exhibit
a fresh green sward, principally of
white clover; and when land is thus
clothed in verdure, it is a sure indication
of a great addition to its fertility,
and that a good crop may then
be expected. When, therefore, the
green sward is thus formed, turn it
under, and then, with the usual culture,
twenty bushels of wheat to the
acre may be expected, where only
ten would have been had without this
previous enriching of the ground by
the application of gypsum. Yet the
same quantity of this manure, applied
as a top dressing to the growing
crop of wheat, would have had no
sensible effect. It should therefore
be understood, that for all growths
which derive little or no benefit from
gypsum, when applied as a top dressing
to the growing plants, the ground
should be previously enriched by applying
this manure to the sward, a
suitable length of time before it is to
be broken up, which length of time
will usually be from two to three
months. At all events as soon as the
sward fully exhibits the effects of the
gypsum it may then be turned under.
Wherever a sward is to be
turned under, this practice should be
invariably pursued in order that the
ground be rendered more fruitful for
the crop that is to follow.</p>

<p>In this country gypsum is a great
source of wealth, wherever soils are
sensible to its effects. It has tended
much to equalize the value of lands,
by imparting an artificial fertility to
those naturally more sterile, and that
at a small expense.&mdash;But gypsum
alone is by no means a sufficient
source of dependence as a manure
for keeping lands in the improved
condition that is necessary for raising
the best crops, and of course deriving
the greatest profits. The farmer
should attend also to making the
most of such other manures as come
conveniently within his reach. We
are, however, no advocate for obtaining
manures at any price; they may
cost too much; but almost every
farmer whose lands are of suitable
quality, and who stocks them with
as many cattle as he can keep in good
order, and then makes the best use
of the manure they afford, may usually,
with this supply, and with the
judicious use of gypsum, added to
good culture, keep his lands in an
improving condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>But some soils are so constituted
as to be of diminished value without
a suitable mixture of other earths
than those of which they are composed,
and in such case are permanently
benefited by such additions of
earthy substances. If lands, for instance,
are too sandy, or gravelly, the
addition of clay to them, or what is
better, of upland marle, will permanently
improve the soil; and where
these earths can be found within reasonable
distance it will usually be labour
well expended in making such
applications. We will state a case
in point. In the rear of the city of
Albany lies an immense body of calcarious
earth, which may properly
be called a schistic marle. It is commonly
called blue clay. This, when
mixed with a due proportion of sand,
forms a very fertile and durable soil.
Farther west of the city lie large
tracts of sandy lands, which require
suitable proportions of this marle to
render them fit for good culture, and
with such additions much of them
would be found very valuable.
Where they lie sufficiently level, and
are not too sandy, it will probably be
found that from half a ton to a ton
for every rod square would be sufficient
to render them very fertile, and
fitted for the most profitable rotations
of crops.</p>

<p>This sort of marle, which may be
found in various parts of the country,
and very frequently under tracts of
sandy lands, is a very valuable and
permanent manure in all dry soils
which are deficient of calcarious matter,
and have not already too great a
proportion of clay in their composition.
This manure should be laid
on the land as a top dressing, in order
that it may be completely pulverized
before it is mixed with the
soil.</p>

<p>Upland marle is sometimes found
of silicious texture, in which case it
is good for stiff soils, as well as for
others. It is also found of different
colours, when combined with argillaceous
matter, and of different qualities;
that containing most lime or calcarious
matter being always the best.
Marles of this description are often
very valuable in forming a principal
ingredient in composts, of which we
shall presently speak, and the same
may be observed of the superior
sorts of this manure found in bog
swamps, of which something shall
now be said.</p>

<p>This sort of marle is found, at
greater or less depths, beneath the
surface of many bog swamps, and is
of a whitish, a greyish, or a brownish
colour. The whitish is the most
powerful, having most lime in its
composition; the greyish is next in
quality. The super stratum is either
a bog earth, to wit, vegetable
matter totally decomposed; or it is a
peaty substance, or vegetable matter
in a partial state of decomposition.
The bog earth is good manure of itself,
and may be used separately, or
mixed with the marle; the peaty substance
must undergo a further decomposition
before it is rendered valuable
as a manure, it being then
rendered similar to bog earth. These
manures when applied to growing
crops are somewhat similar in their
effects to those of gypsum. They
are valuable as top dressings, or for
mixing with the soil. Their effects
are very powerful on Indian corn,
and they are more or less valuable
when applied to almost every sort of
upland crop, with the exception of
wheat, rye, barley, &amp;c. For these
they are to be applied to the sward,
a suitable time before breaking it up,
as has been mentioned in regard to
gypsum. It should, however, be observed,
that neither decomposed peat,
nor bog earth, should be applied to
soils which already contain too great
a proportion of decomposed vegetable
matter.</p>

<p>The condition of clay soils is also
permanently improved by mixing a
due proportion of sand in them. The
most durable and perfect soil is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
chiefly composed of certain proportions
of sand, clay, lime, and vegetable
matter in a state of decomposition,
and, whenever any soil is destitute
of a due proportion of any of
these, the addition of such earthy
substance can never fail to serve as a
manure.</p>

<p>The stony earth called Pyrites,
when pulverised by the aid of a proper
degree of calcination, is much
used; and highly esteemed in Flanders
as a top dressing for grass lands,
as is mentioned in a communication
of the late Chancellor Livingston to
the Society for the promotion of the
useful arts in this state. We will
refer the reader to the 2d vol. published
by that Society for the manner
of preparing this manure, and the
quantity to be used, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Of coal, we shall merely state
that, from the results of experiments
made by the late Mr. Muhlenburg,
(of Penn.) about 40 bushels to the
acre of this substance, pulverised in
the manner of gypsum, was found
a good manure, when applied as a
top dressing.</p>

<p>Common salt, pulverised, and applied
as a top dressing, at the rate
of from two to four bushels to the
acre, has, in many instances, powerful
effects as a manure. Sea-water
is peculiarly adapted for this purpose.
Mr. Deane, in his Farmer's Dictionary,
mentions an instance where a
crop of potatoes, and another of flax,
were greatly increased in product by
an application of sea-water to them
while growing. About a pint of the
water was applied to each hill of
potatoes, and for the flax crop the
water was sprinkled over the ground.</p>

<p>Some trials have been made in this
country of using burnt clay as a manure,
and its use is recommended,
particularly for all dry arable lands,
not inclining to clay. The first step
in preparation for burning clay, is to
have a considerable quantity of this
earth dug up in spits, and laid to dry
in the sun: when pretty well dried
you prepare for burning by raising a
little pile of dry wood in the shape
of a pyramid, say 4 or 5 feet high;&mdash;round
this you build up the dried
spits of clay, leaving a hole at the
bottom, for the entrance of the air,
and another at the top for it to pass
off. Such, at least, was the method
formerly practised in Great Britain,
but the modern improvement of retaining
the smoke within the mass,
agreeably to the plan spoken of by
Mr. Cobbett, for burning earth,
ought also to be pursued in burning
clay. After the fire has been set to
the wood you continue digging up
fresh clay and piling it around and
over the heap, as fast as the fire penetrates
the mass, taking care, however,
not to pile on so much at once
as to extinguish the fire. If there
be danger of its becoming extinguished,
it may be advisable to make one
or more holes in the sides of the
heap by running a hole into it. The
fresh earth is to be added during
pleasure or until a sufficient quantity
is burned. After the heap has
cooled it is fit for use, either by mixing
with the soil as directed by Mr.
Cobbett, for applying burnt earth, of
which we will next speak.</p>

<p>By a late improvement, earths,
other than those of clay, are successfully
converted into good manure,
by the process of burning. It is effected
by retaining the smoke within
the mass of earth while in a state of
ignition. Mr. Cobbett says he has
tried this manure for the ruta-baga
crop, and found it as efficacious as
barn dung. His manner of preparing
it, and which we believe would
also be the best method of preparing
burnt clay, is as follows:</p>

<p>"I make a circle," says Mr. C.
"or an oblong square. I cut sods
and build a wall all round three feet
thick, and four feet high. I then
light a fire in the middle with straw,
dry sticks, boughs, or such like matter.
I go on making this fire larger
and larger, till it extend over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
whole bottom of the pit or kiln. I
put on roots of trees or any rubbish
wood, till there be a good thickness
of strong coals. I then put on the
<em>driest</em> of the clods that I have ploughed
up round about, so as to cover all
the fire over. The earth thus put
in will burn. You will see the smoke
coming out at little places here and
there. Put more clods wherever the
smoke appears. Keep on thus for a
day or two. By this time a great mass
of fire will be in the inside. And
now you may dig out the clay, or
earth, any where round the kiln, and
fling it on without ceremony, always
taking care to <em>keep in the smoke</em>;
for, if you suffer that to continue coming
out at any one place, a hole will
soon be made; the main force of the
fire will draw to that hole; a blaze
like that of a volcano, will come out,
and the fire will be extinguished.</p>

<p>"A very good way is to put your
finger into the top of the heap here
and there; and if you find the fire
<em>very near</em>, throw on more earth.&mdash;Not
<em>too much at a time</em>, for that
weighs too heavily on the fire, and
keeps it back; and, at <em>first</em> will put
it partially out. You keep on thus
augmenting the kiln, till you get to
the top of the walls, and then you
may, if you like, raise the walls and
still go on. No rain will affect the
fire, when once it is become strong.</p>

<p>"The principle is to <em>keep out air</em>,
whether at the top or the sides,
and this you are sure to do, if you
<em>keep in the smoke</em>. I burnt, this last
summer, about thirty wagon loads in
one round kiln, and never saw the
smoke at all after the first four days.
I put in my finger to try whether the
fire was near the top; and when I
found it approaching, I put on more
earth. Never was a kiln more completely
burnt.</p>

<p>"Now, this may be done on the
skirt of any wood where the matters
are all at hand. This mode is far
preferable to the <em>above ground</em> burning
in <em>heaps</em>. Because in the next
place, the <em>smoke escapes there</em>, which
is the finest part of the burnt matter.
<em>Soot</em>, we know well, is more powerful
than ashes, and, soot is composed
of the <em>grossest parts of the smoke</em>.
That which flies out of the chimney
is the best part of all.</p>

<p>"In case of a want of wood wherewith
to begin the fire, the fire may
be lighted precisely as in the case of
<em>paring and burning</em>. If the kiln be
large, the oblong square is the best
figure.&mdash;About <em>ten feet wide</em>, because
then a man can fling the earth easily
over every part. The mode they
pursue in England when there is no
<em>wood</em>, is to make a sort of building
in the kiln with turfs and leave air
holes at the corners of the walls, till
the fire be well begun. But this is
tedious work; and is in this country
wholly unnecessary. Care must, however,
be taken, that the fire be well
lighted. The matter put in <em>at first</em>
should be such as is of the lightest
description; so that a body of earth
on fire may be obtained, before it be
too heavily loaded.</p>

<p>"The burning being completed,
having got the quantity you want,
let the kiln remain. The fire will
continue to work, until all is ashes.
If you want <em>use</em> the ashes sooner,
open the kiln. They will be cold
enough to remove in a week."</p>

<p>A practice has long prevailed in
Europe of paring and burning soils
for the purpose of improving their
texture and increasing their fertility.
On clay lands, and such as contain
too much vegetable matter, we conceive
the process might be advisable
if not too expensive. Its effect
on clays is to destroy the adhesive
quality of the soil, as the earth burned
becomes rather of a silicious texture;
and at the same time the surface
is much enriched by the operation.
In the other case it is calculated
to reduce the redundancy of vegetable
matter, as well as to enrich
the soil. The operation is performed
in the following manner:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>When the ground is in a good
sward of grass let it be carefully turned
over with the plough, the irons of
which should be well sharpened. Let
the plough run about three inches
deep.&mdash;Then cross plough with a
very sharp coulter, and the sward
will all be cut into squares of about
10 or 12 inches. You then proceed
to set these square chunks up edgeways,
by leaning two together, in
which situation they will soon dry.&mdash;When
well dried build a part of them
tip in the form of little ovens, and let
this be done at the distance of about
every 18 feet each way. These are
all to have a little opening or door,
at a common windward side, for the
air to enter, and another opening
above for the smoke to pass off. On
some dry day when the wind is fair
for blowing into the holes below place
some straw or other dry rubbish into
the holes and set fire to it. As soon
as the fires have got fully going in
each of the heaps, let the holes in
the tops be stopped up, for the purpose
of retaining the smoke, and keep
gradually building up the heaps as
the fire penetrates them, until all
the chunks of earth are piled up
round them; and when the heaps
have fully burned and sufficiently
cooled, they are to be evenly spread
over the ground, and ploughed in.</p>

<p>In some parts of Great Britain it
has been the practice to burn peat
earth, in a manner very similar to
that before described for burning
clay, and the ashes thus obtained from
the mass were used for top dressings;
but we believe this practice has mostly
given way to that of rotting or decomposing
peat in compost, the method
of which is as follows: you form
the compost heap of about one half
of peat, a fourth of lime, and a fourth
of barn dung, and these substances
are to be separately laid along in a
manner most convenient to be afterwards
thrown into the compost heap
in their proper proportions. You
commence at one end with spreading
a layer of peat on the ground,
say, ten feet square and four inches
in depth; then a layer of lime on this
and another of barn dung, each two
inches thick; then another layer of
peat, as before, and then the lime
and barn dung, as before, until in
this way the heap is raised about four
feet high, and let the last layer be of
peat: then commence another ten
feet square along side of this, and
raise it as before, till you raise it to
the same height; then with another
ten feet square, at the end of this
mass, and so on, till the heap is completed.
After the heap has stood a
while, it will heat, and when the heat
begins to subside, you commence
again at one end of the heap and cut
the whole down to the bottom, with
the spade, and form a new heap,
throwing the exterior parts of the
heap, thus cut down, into the middle
of the other. A second heating of
the mass will then commence, and
when that subsides, the peat will be
found sufficiently decomposed, and
the whole an excellent mass of manure.</p>

<p>In this country peaty substances
are usually to be found in morasses;
as the superstratum of marle, as before-mentioned;
as the principal ingredient
of the salt marshes contiguous
to the ocean, and as the superstratum
of tracts of cold lands
which are covered with growths of
evergreen trees.</p>

<p>In making composts with upland
marle, before-mentioned, the proportions
of the marle, with that of the
lime and dung, may be similar to
those just mentioned for the peat
composts, or perhaps the marle may
be in greater proportion. The layers
of each may be as before described,
but the heap only raised to such
height that it may be cleft down to
the bottom with the plough, then
thrown together in a ridge again with
this implement; and let these operations
be repeated, at intervals, till the
whole becomes well mixed, pulveris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>ed,
and in a state of fermentation,
when it is fit for use, and should be
immediately applied to the soil in
the manner before-mentioned.</p>

<p>The use of wood ashes as a manure,
is well known. It is good for
almost all crops, and is to be used as
a top dressing. It is much more efficacious
as a manure in some parts
of the country than others, particularly
on Long Island. It is most valuable
on light dry soils, particularly
those which are sandy. Soot, as a
top dressing, is much more valuable
than ashes, and is proper for almost
all arable lands. It is most efficacious
when well pulverised before
its application.</p>

<p>The dung of fowls of every sort
has much calcareous matter in it,
and is very efficacious, applied as top
dressings. Malt dust is good in the
same way&mdash;40 bushels of it is a proper
allowance to the acre.</p>

<p><em>Night shade</em> should be mixed with
earth, say, two thirds of the latter to
one of the former, and in the course
of a few months it forms an excellent
manure. In most European cities
this excrement is carefully collected,
for manure, while in this
country its use has been neglected.</p>

<p>Many liquids are furnished from
every domicile, and particularly the
kitchen, which, mixed with earths,
and other substances, would form valuable
masses of manure. The liquids
to which we principally refer,
are the soap-suds, dish-water, brine
of meat, urine, &amp;c.; these should all
be preserved, by being absorbed in
rich earthy substances, together with
the contents of the hog-sty; and in
this way a large heap of good manure
may be made that is commonly
lost for want of attention in saving
these ingredients.</p>

<em>Agricultural Education.</em></h2>


<p>No cause has more retarded the
progress of education in the agricultural
part of the community than a
mistaken opinion, in regard to the
use that can be made of it.&mdash;That
the advantages of learning, in every
state of society, should not be appreciated
by the grossly ignorant, is
not to be wondered at; but that men
well informed on many subjects,
should fall into the vulgar error of
denying the advantages arising from
extensive knowledge is really surprising.</p>

<p>We hear it frequently observed
by farmers, who have sons to educate,
that they intend such a one to
follow his own occupation; and it
will be necessary that he should be
taught to read, write, and cypher to
the "Rule of Three." Now it is believed
with these <em>extensive</em> acquirements,
a farmer will be able to keep
his accounts tolerably decent; to estimate
the amount of any number of
bushels of grain, at a given sum per
bushel: but I shall forbear to mention
all the advantages which this
kind of knowledge may confer. The
intelligent farmer well knows it has
a boundary, and a very limited one
too. To endeavour by force of reason
to induce this class of farmers to
abandon their errors, would be time
spent to little purpose; their minds
are not recipient for truths which lie
beyond the narrow boundary of their
learning.</p>

<p>It is to the enlightened and public
spirited yeomanry of our country,
that we are to look for a change in
the education of our youth.&mdash;Change,
did I say? Rather an entire new system
of education. I ask this class
of farmers if they have any such a
thing as an agricultural education
among them. I mean an elementary,
a systematic one: we train our
youth (at school) for the counting-house,
and not for the farm. We
teach them the mysteries of the <em>cent
per cent</em>; all the dark intricacies of
annuities, all the crooks and turns,
and all the advantages of barter, discount
and fellowship. While of Na<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>tural
Philosophy, Chemistry, Botany,
Mineralogy, Geology and other sciences,
directly or indirectly connected
with agriculture, they remain
as ignorant as if they never were to
apply any of the principles to practice.
Can it then be wondered that
agriculture has advanced so little?
Ought we not rather to wonder that
it has advanced so much as it has,
since so little pains are taken to qualify
our youth to make improvement
in it? As an art it is perhaps more
capable of improvement than any
other, because the sciences on which
it is founded, are more numerous and
more extensive in their nature.</p>

<p>By whom are improvements to be
made? by men whose knowledge of
the art has never deviated from the
beaten track which their forefathers
had trodden, and this knowledge was
bequeathed to them with this condition,
"thus far shalt thou go and no
farther?" Common sense answers in
the negative. Do we expect important
improvements in our present
systems of agriculture, from men
who have been educated merchants
or schoolmasters? Their minds cannot
be sufficiently interested in such
subjects to pursue them either with
ardour or with profit. They have
never acquired a taste for those studies
which would render the different
operations of farming a series of
philosophical experiments.</p>

<p>In too many instances, farmers'
sons, who have been educated as
above described, lose all relish for
their occupation, and engage in
some mercantile business. In many
instances they contrive to worry
through life without deserting their
calling, though they receive little
pleasure from any part of it, except
counting the money which it yields.
The source from which we have received
our new systems of farming
lay in quite a different quarter. Inhabitants
of cities, or men who have
been educated for some learned profession,
are our teachers in the rules
of husbandry. We will suppose these
men to be well versed in the sciences
above alluded to. But have they
ever learned their application to agriculture?
If not, as well might they
adduce principles on that subject, as
a person to attempt solving an abstruse
problem in surveying, who
has only learned the elements of geometry.
When I spoke of an <em>agricultural
education</em>, I did not confine
my views to the sciences above specified.
<em>Practice</em> is an indispensable
part of this education. The chemist
may sit in his laboratory and give us
a system of agriculture, stolen from
European treatises, and may occasionally
sprinkle it with some hard
words of his own; but it is only the
<em>practical and scientific farmer</em> that
can draw from this heterogenous
mass, all that is valuable and applicable
to his own purpose, and nothing
more. The principles he receives
from books must be tested by
experiment. To make important deductions
from these experiments, unwearied
patience must be exercised,
in order to sift real conclusions from
those which are only plausible. Let
him not sit down supinely, after having
ascertained a rule, for general
rules in this science as in most others
have their exceptions, and an accurate
knowledge of these exceptions
will require much time for discernment,
and investigation. If agriculture,
then, is an art of calling forth
all the faculties of the mind, why is
it not taught like other arts by a regular
and systematic education?</p>

<p>The object of these papers is to

commerce, and consump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>tion
of the utmost importance to the
prosperity of our country. The forms
and niceties of literary composition
will yield their claim to attention to
the more solid substance of the pertinent
information and suggestions.</p>

<p>In the course of the consideration
of this subject, several letters from
living friends to our prosperity have
been brought together. The remainder
of this paper will be appropriated
to the publication of one of those
letters, of very recent date, from a
native of the United States, of the
best opportunities, in <em>Bordeaux</em>, the
emporium of that part of the kingdom
of France which gives to us the
largest quantities of the most esteemed
wines and brandies which enter
into our regular consumption. It here
follows, in its own clear and instructive
terms.</p>

<p>"I have been favoured by your
letter of the 24th. <em>Chaptal</em>, sur la
Culture de Vine, <em>l'Abbe Rozier's</em>
memoire sur le mellieure maniere
de faire et gouverner les Vins, and
<em>Jullien's</em> Topographie de tout les
Vignobles, are the authors the most
in repute in France on the vine and
on wine. The first and last can be
had in Philadelphia; and if <em>Rozier's</em>
memoir is not to be found, as it is an
old book, you can doubtless find at
your French book stores, his Dictionary
of Agriculture, 5 vols. in 4to.
which, under the head of <em>Vine</em>, will
give you all the information you desire.</p>

<p>"The district which produces the
best wine, about Bordeaux, is <em>Medoc</em>.
That county is divided into upper and
lower <em>Medoc</em>, lying between the Gironde
and Garonne and the Bay of Biscay.
It is much such a country, as to
hill and dale, or general surface, as
that between Philadelphia and Trenton,
of a sandy, sandy-loam, and gravelly
soil, with some few exceptions
of small patches. About seven leagues
from north to south, and three from
east to west, of this district, is occupied
with vineyards, which produce
the best wine, whose expositions are
from east to south.</p>

<p>"In this district, Lafitte, Chateau
Margaux, Latour, Leoville, La Rose,
Braune Mouton, and St. Julien, with
various other qualities of Claret, are
produced, which bring from $60 dollars
the ton, of 4 hogsheads, (or 252
gallons,) to $600, according to the
estimation they are held in. The
vines in this district are not suffered
to grow above three feet from the
ground.</p>

<p>"<em>Hautbriant</em> is produced on a single
estate of that name, lying in La
Grave, about a league south of Bordeaux.
The soil is sandy and gravelly;
so much so that you would hardly
suppose it capable of vegetation.</p>

<p>"The districts which produce <em>Sauterne</em>,
<em>Barsac</em>, and <em>Grave</em> wines, lie
from the skirts of the city south about
four leagues, presenting much the
same swell of surface as that part of
New Jersey through which the mail
runs between Trenton and Brunswick.
The name of this district, (or,
more properly speaking, the northern
part of it,) <em>Grave</em>, denotes its
soil <em>Gravier</em>&mdash;<em>Gravel</em>. I have seen
hundreds of acres of vines in <em>Grave</em>,
growing in pebbles, from the size of
a bean and nutmeg to that of an egg,
without the least vestige of earth,
cracking under foot, and filling one's
shoes. Of the white wines of Bordeaux,
<em>Sauterne</em>, <em>Barsac</em>, and <em>Corbonnieux</em>
are of the first quality; but
there are many other growths which
vie with them, and the ordinary qualities
of these white wines are various.
I have purchased good pleasant
white wine at six dollars the cask of
sixty-three gallons. The quantities
sent to this country cost from $12
the cask to $40. Of the other wines
you mention, I have no knowledge.</p>

<p>"It has been stated that two millions
of acres are taken up in the
cultivation of the vine, in France,
producing, one year with another, five
hogsheads of sixty-three gallons to
the acre; which, at the moderate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
price of fifty francs, or ten dollars,
the hogshead, gives one hundred millions
of dollars. This produce is immense;
and, what renders it still more
valuable is, that it does not lessen the
quantity of other necessary productions,
such as wheat, &amp;c.; for where
the vine generally grows <em>in France</em>,
nothing else will grow: such is the
poverty of the soil generally employed
for vines.</p>

<p>"They have the wild vine in
France. I have seen large quantities
of it near <em>Bayonne</em>, and round
the foot of the Pyrenees, up to <em>Pau</em>:
the inhabitants make beautiful hedges
of it, and I have been assured by a
distinguished naturalist, Mr. Pennieres,
who is now in the Alabama territory,
that some of the excellent
grapes of France have been produced
from the wild vine, after some
years of careful cultivation. He is now
engaged in inoculating our wild vines
with those of France, from which he
expects the most favourable results.</p>

<p>"I shall conclude these hasty observations
by an extract from <em>Rozier</em>:</p>

<p>"'The vine is a plant whose transpiration
and <em>suction</em> is <em>abundant</em> and
<em>vehement, which sufficiently indicates
the soil and exposition natural to it</em>.
For this reason, grounds, <em>composed of
sand, gravel stones, and rotten rocks</em>,
are excellent for its cultivation.</p>

<p>"'A <em>sandy</em> soil produces <em>a fine
pure</em> wine. The <em>gravelly</em> and <em>stony</em> a
delicate wine. Rotten and broken
rocks a fumy generous wine, of a superior
quality.</p>

<p>"'A rich, strong, compact, cold or
humid soil, which is pressed down by
the rains, and which the sun hardens
or bakes, is essentially prejudicial to
the quality of the wine.</p>

<p>"'The most advantageous exposition
for the vine is that of a gentle
slope, or side of a hill, facing east
and south, on which the rays of the
sun continue the longest time.</p>

<p>"'Hills, in the neighbourhood of
the ocean and rivers, ought to be preferred
to all others.' The lower parts
of these hills are not so favourable to
the vine as the upper, and neither are
equal to the middle region, the soil
being the same.</p>

<p>"'<em>All trees are unfriendly to the
vine</em>, as much from their roots as
their shade. All who cultivate the
vine, should remember this precept
of Virgil: <i lang="la">Apertos Bacchus amat colles.</i>&mdash;The
vine flourishes in the open
unshaded hills.</p>

<p>"'In a word, the vine ought never
to be planted in soils that can produce
grain, &amp;c. because it wants nothing
but heat, and thrives best in the poorest
ground. This will appear ridiculous
to those who look for <em>quantity</em>:
but as to the quality of the wine, it is in
strict conformity with the laws of vegetation
and with experience. I must
be understood to speak here of countries
only whose temperatures are favourable
to the success of vineyards.
We must except those in more northern
latitudes. These general precepts
admit of no exceptions: They
will be acknowledged by all those
who, with good faith, and free of prejudices,
have studied the cultivation
of the vine. If other modes and precepts
are followed, we cannot answer
for the age of the vine, or the quality
of the wine.'"</p>

<p>These views of the locality, soils,
and exposures of the fine <em>Bordeaux</em>
wines, such as the white, or <em>Sauterne</em>,
and <em>vin de Grave</em>, and the red or clarets,
such as <em>La Fitte</em>, <em>Chateau Margaux</em>,
&amp;c. will be left, for the present,
on the public mind, with a firm confidence
in their due impression, accompanied
by the remarks that the
difference between our temperatures,
in our present wooded condition, and
that of the south west of France, may
be safely taken at eleven or twelve
degrees; and that the progress of
clearing lands and draining swamps
will reduce that difference, in a few
years, below ten degrees. Thus, St.
Mary's, in Georgia, will ultimately
prove about as warm, for vegetation,
as Oporto in Portugal, and the pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>ductions
of Europe, in any given latitude,
may be found in, or, as we
drain and clear, introduced into the
United States, in latitudes nine or ten
degrees farther south. The pride of

<h3>ADDRESS.</h3>

<p>Gentlemen of the Agricultural Society.</p>

<p>When you did me the honour of requesting
me to deliver this Address, you
did not expect that I should enter into minute
details of the process of Agriculture.
Such an attempt might expose my own
ignorance, but could not add to your information.
The object of our Society is
<em>the promotion of Agriculture</em>. Whatever
conduces to this end, either immediately or
even remotely, is worthy of our attention,
and within the scope of our Association.
In this view of the subject, I perceive so
wide a range, that there is less difficulty
in finding objects, than in making a proper
selection. To call forth the exertions
of the Society its zeal must be excited.
But zeal is not to be excited, without a
conviction of the importance of the cause
in which we are engaged. May I be permitted
then, to declare my conviction, that
amidst the profusion of Societies with
which the present age abounds, there is
none more useful, or more dignified, than
that for the <em>promotion of Agriculture</em>. Indeed,
in point of <em>utility</em>, I might justly say
that it <em>precedes</em> all others. Because, even if
mankind could exist without Agriculture,
yet they could exist only in a savage state,
and in small numbers. The great command
"<em>increase and multiply</em>," could not be obeyed.
There could be nothing worthy the
name of art, or science, or literature. When
I cast my eye on the map of Pennsylvania,
and view the vast quantity of excellent
land, in the rude state in which nature formed
it, I am struck with astonishment at the
multitudes which throng our cities, struggling
with hunger, cold, and disease. Nor is
my wonder confined to the lower orders of
society. For I see many of liberal education,
and with the means of acquiring a competency
in the country, wasting their lives
in disgraceful idleness, or fruitless efforts
to force their way through the crowds
which block up every avenue to profit
or preferment. The flood of commerce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
which set upon our shores during five
and twenty years of war and disorder in
Europe, has given to our cities a premature
growth. In every branch of trade
and commerce there are too many competitors.
Labourers are too numerous.
Every mechanic art, every liberal profession
is overdone. Happy would it be for
the city, and happy for the country, if
any efforts of this Society could inspire
a respect, and a taste, for an <em>art</em> in which
no man need be ashamed to employ his
faculties; for a <em>condition</em>, which after all,
seems most congenial to the nature of
man. It is a life, to which, at one time
or other, we all aspire. For who is there,
that amidst the eager pursuit of wealth
or ambition, does not sometimes pause,
and console himself with the fond, though
often fallacious hope, of passing his latter
days in the independence, the ease,
the plenty, the safety, and the innocence
of the country! In Pennsylvania, young
men of education would have peculiar advantages
in spreading themselves through
the country, for it is a fact (and we are
every day feeling the effects of it) that
in no state in the union, is education so
much confined to towns. There are many
inhabitants of this city, who hold extensive
tracts of land, which neither they
nor their children have ever seen. This
is a bad state of things. For, through
ignorance of the quality, the situation,
and value of their lands, these persons
are sometimes a prey to speculators, and
sometimes, erring on the contrary extreme,
they conceive extravagant notions, and refuse
to sell at a fair price. Hence Agriculture
suffers&mdash;either the land remains
a desert, or they are occupied by poor
intruders, who knowing the instability of
their title, are afraid to attempt any valuable
improvement. These people, with
few exceptions, lead a wretched life, and
are apt to imbibe sentiments hostile to
the proprietors of the soil, whom they
consider as natural enemies. Could the
parties but see each other, very different
feelings might prevail. A little kindness
and condescension on the part of the
proprietor, might convert a discontented
trespasser, into a useful tenant or purchaser.
That this has happened in many
instances, I know; which induces me to
think, that were the trial made, it would
happen in many more. Where large property
of this kind, is in the hands of heads
of families with several children, one or
two of the sons might manage the estate
to great advantage, by living on the spot.
Agents are expensive, and often unfaithful.
But one may confide in his own
blood. Besides, the very circumstance of
a well educated young man residing in
any place, will naturally attract others of
similar qualifications, to the same spot;
and thus an agreeable society might be
formed, and great encouragement afforded
to the labouring poor of the neighbourhood.
In this kind of policy, the state of
New York has set us a good example.
And the consequences of her conduct are
obvious; a greater proportion of her lands
is settled, and her unsettled lands, of
equal quality, sell for a higher price than
ours. Although the views of our society
are not confined to the limits of the state,
and our earnest wishes are for the prosperity
of the whole, and every part of the
union, yet it may be considered as our duty
to direct our attention more particularly
to Pennsylvania. We cannot be accused
then of acting with ungenerous policy,
if we endeavour to promote the settlement
of our own lands in preference to
those of our neighbours. We may, without
impropriety, suggest all fair and honourable
arguments, to convince the emigrants
from the eastern states, and from
Europe, that it is their interest to establish
themselves here, rather than seek a residence
in a distant country, to the west or
the south. It is not my intention to enter
deeply into this subject. It might be
enough, to suggest to the Society, the utility
of circulating good pamphlets, which
have already been written, or may be
written hereafter. But, one or two leading
facts it may not be amiss to mention.
The rich productions of the south, are not
to be attained, but by men of considerable
capital. The object is tempting, but
when offered to the consideration of emigrants
from Europe, or our sister states to
the eastward, they will remember that the
climate where rice, cotton, tobacco, indigo,
and sugar flourish, is generally unfavourable
to health; and that these articles
are not to be cultivated to advantage,
without slaves. They have therefore to
engage in a new kind of life, opposed to
the habits and principles in which they
have been educated, and which, however
flattering the outset, will probably terminate
in an enfeebled body and discontented
mind.</p>

<p>But the great class of emigrants, is that
of people who have small capitals, and
must seek their bread, by the labour of
their own hands. To such persons, health
is every thing. The languid eye of sickness
dwells without pleasure, on the fairest
prospects of nature. In vain is the fertile
bottom, or the rich prairie, offered to
the arm unnerved by disease. It is a no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>torious
fact, that rich, low, level countries,
are subject to fevers. They should therefore
be shunned by those who are to live
by their own labour. Another great inconvenience
in those countries is, that they
are badly supplied with water, either for
drinking or machinery. If, indeed, the
lands in the western region, were extremely
cheap, and those in Pennsylvania at a
price beyond the reach of a poor man, he
must go to the west from necessity. But
that is not the case,&mdash;our lands are believed
to be as low priced, as those beyond
the Ohio; and much more so, when there
is taken into the calculation (as there
ought to be) the expense of the journey.
Another important circumstance in our favour,
is a much better market for the
sale of our productions, and the purchase
of necessary articles. This is important at
all times, but peculiarly in war, when the
Mississippi, the only inlet or outlet of the
whole western country, may be blockaded
by a hostile fleet.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let it not be supposed, that the interests
of Agriculture and of Commerce are at
variance. On the contrary, they are inseparable.
Of this the Agriculturists of the
United States have had good proof. No
persons on earth have profited more by
commerce. During the long wars of Europe,
the staple productions of the middle
states sold at double price, and those
of the southern states were very high,
both during the war and after. Those
prices were produced, in part, by the influx
of wealth, which occasioned an increased
consumption at home, and in part
by exportation to foreign countries, but
principally by the latter. Both causes,
however, sprang from commerce; and
both, as long as commerce exists, will continue
to operate in a greater or less degree.
Indeed, if we could suppose a nation
cut off from all intercourse with other
nations, (that is, from all foreign commerce)
that nation, though abounding in
all the necessaries of life, would be barbarous,
selfish, illiteral, and ignorant. Neither
let us give way to the idea, that either
agriculture, or commerce, are incompatible
with domestic manufactures. Unwise
laws, may injure either one or the other,
by unjust preferences; but under proper
regulations, they will aid, and invigorate
each other. This is not the place for entering
into a disquisition of the degree of
encouragement which should be afforded
by <em>law</em>, to manufactures. That important
subject is before the national legislature,
where it will no doubt, receive an impartial
and mature consideration. But thus much
may be said, with certainty; that it is the
<em>duty</em>, as well as the <em>interest</em>, of all of us,
to use <em>our own</em>, in preference to <em>foreign</em>
manufactures, where they can be furnished
on reasonable terms. It cannot be denied,
that manufactures afford a sure market,
for the productions of the neighbouring
country; and as they are multiplied,
in the same ratio, are the markets increased.
And there is a peculiar advantage in
markets of this kind, at a distance from
navigable waters; that, the consumption
being at home, the expense of carriage is
saved. But, there is a kind of manufacture,
<em>domestic in the strictest sense</em>, the benefit
of which is inestimable, because
while it adds to the <em>stock</em> of the family, it
protects their <em>morals</em>.&mdash;I allude to spinning,
weaving, and such things as are done
by the hands of the husband, the wife, or
the children, without leaving their home.
It guards them against <em>idleness</em>, that child
of folly, and parent of vice, and is often
clear gain, as it occupies those hours which
would have been passed in inaction. I am
afraid, that in this kind of industry, we
have rather degenerated. A very respectable
gentleman, a member of the Society
of Friends, informed me, that about the
year 1764, he attended a meeting, in Chester
county, near the borders of Maryland,
and that most of his society in that neighbourhood,
were clothed <em>completely</em> and
<em>handsomely</em> in dress of their own manufacture.
Were he to visit that meeting
now, I doubt whether he would see his
friends in the same kind of apparel. Yet
meritorious examples are not wanting,
even now, and I hope I shall be excused
for mentioning one lately communicated
to me. In the western part of Pennsylvania,
on this side of the Alleghany river,
lives a man, who, ten or twelve years ago,
seated himself on a tract of land, to which
he had no title, in the humble character of a
<em>squatter</em>.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> This man has converted a wilderness
into a fine farm; and, with the assistance
of an industrious wife, brought up
a large family of children. He raises on his
farm all the materials for clothing the family;
and whatever they wear, of linen or
woollen texture, excellent in their kinds,
is spun, woven, and manufactured in the
house. They also make their own sugar,
from the maple; and their own leather; and
<em>purchase</em> (or rather <em>barter</em> for) nothing but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>iron, and salt. Their farming utensils are
chiefly homemade.&mdash;But what is more commendable
than all (and perhaps the cause
of all) <em>very little whiskey or ardent spirits is
drunk</em> by any of them. To finish the picture,
I have to add, that the proprietor of
the land, with views, no less <em>politic</em> than <em>liberal</em>,
has confirmed these good people in
their title, on moderate terms&mdash;so that
this little story contains a moral, from
which, both <em>settlers</em>, and <em>proprietors</em>, may
profit.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> A term in use, in New York and Pennsylvania,
to denote a man who seats himself
on land to which he has no title.</p></div>

<p>It has been apprehended by some, that
the late fall in the price of land, and its
productions, would damp the ardour of
cultivators, and deter men of capital from
employing their funds in the purchase of
real property. This apprehension appears
to be ill founded. If the profits of farming
have been diminished, so likewise
have the profits of all other business; so
that there is no particular reason for withholding
funds from an investment in land.
We are in a state of distress, which I trust,
will be but temporary; for the country has
great resources, and sufficient knowledge
to bring them into action. A stagnation of
commerce was to be expected, on the cessation
of the wars in Europe.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> But this
stagnation is not peculiar to America&mdash;she
shares it in common with all the
world&mdash;we have indeed, particular distress,
arising from our own errors, on the
subject of banks. An immoderate issue
of bank paper, afforded an unhappy facility
of borrowing. The money when
borrowed, must be made use of in some
way&mdash;many of the borrowers, having no
good use for it, either trifled it away, in
unnecessary expenses, or in the purchase
of land, which soon rose, nominally, to
twice its value. Such a state of things
could not last long&mdash;the delusion is past.
It is to be lamented, that many good people
have been the victims of this infatuation;
but we must comfort ourselves with
the hope, that some good will result from
it, if a cure is not attempted by rash and
violent means. As a people, we had become
too extravagant and too luxurious.
The slow but sure progress of industry
was despised. Every man was in haste
to be rich, by some visionary project, dignified
with the name of <em>speculation</em>. But
we are now suffering for these follies, and
by suffering, we shall be purified, and
brought back to better habits. This will
be a lasting good. Instead of desponding
then, let us prosecute our business with
increased vigour and economy, and we
shall soon find, that although we have
fewer paper dollars, we have more real
wealth, and what is of much greater importance,
better morals, and of course
more happiness. A large capital is at present
locked up, because the owners are
in doubt how to employ it. When business
shall flow in decided channels, this
capital will be brought into activity. It
is almost certain, that neither commerce,
nor bank stock will be as profitable as
they have been; so that there is a strong
probability of an investment of a large capital,
in real estate, which, after all, possesses
a stability unknown to any other
kind of property.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> In a letter of the late President Adams,
published since the delivery of this Address,
he says he remembers that the like
depression of commerce, manufactures and
real estate, took place after the wars, which
ended in 1748, 1763, and 1783.</p></div>

<p>But, it is in our own power, to increase
the value of our lands by an improved state
of Agriculture. Much has been done, but
much more remains to be done. Though
not at the bottom of the hill, we have not
yet ascended half its height. It may be encouraging
however to stop for a moment,
and take a glance at the progress we have
made. Before the war of the revolution,
little of science was blended with the art
of agriculture&mdash;things had gone on in
their natural course. The counties first
settled, now known by the names of Philadelphia,
Delaware, Chester, Montgomery,
and Bucks, though not rich (except
the meadows) were sufficient to yield
good crops at first, and tolerable ones for
a number of years. But the soil near the
surface, composed of vegetable substances
accumulated during the lapse of ages, became
at length exhausted by repeated tillage
without refreshment. Red clover was
introduced before the war, but it was produced
in small quantities, and almost solely
for the purpose of hay. The system
of melioration by a rotation of crops, in
which grass took its turn, was not understood.
Natural meadow was in great
demand, and not much hay being produced
on the uplands, it was impossible to
support during winter, a stock sufficiently
large to amass a great quantity of manure.
Consequently the crops of grain, and particularly
of wheat were much diminished.
Indeed, the <em>wheat</em> crops were trifling.
Gypsum had been imported, in small quantities
before the revolution; but it was
very little used, and very little talked of;
and that little not to its credit, for an old
proverb, said to come from Germany, was
brought up against it, "<em>that gypsum made
rich fathers, but poor sons</em>." Notwithstand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>ing
this prejudice, it was brought into
general use, some years after the war, by
the persevering efforts of a few, <em>and principally
of the President of this Society</em>, to
whom future generations will render
thanks for this important service. Through
the efficacy of this fossil, the face of the
country experienced a magic change. The
uplands were clothed with rich herbage, to
which succeeded plenteous crops of grain.
I have not been able to trace with certainty,
the progress of the cultivation of clover
aided by gypsum, but I believe, that
Philadelphia was the centre, from which
it spread in all directions. In Chester county,
so great were its effects, that (as I
heard it proved in the trial of a cause at
West Chester,) the price of lands was
doubled in a few years. Nor is there any
reason to suppose that it was less beneficial
in other places.</p>

<p>But as the excess of even a good thing
may be pernicious, so may it be with gypsum.
That it promotes the growth of many
vegetables, and of clover in particular,
is certain; though its mode of operation
does not seem to be clearly understood.
An increased quantity of grass, will support
an increased quantity of stock, from
which will proceed an increased quantity
of manure, and that should be considered
as the great end of gypsum. Not that
great advantages may not be derived from
ploughing in the green clover. But if
that is relied on, as the only mode of meliorating
the soil, (and in some publications
which I have seen, it is asserted to
be quite sufficient) we shall probably be
disappointed. In Sir John Sinclair's Code
of Agriculture, it is said that the practice
of ploughing in green vegetables, as a manure,
has been tried, in England, and
found not to answer; and that more benefit
is derived from those crops, when
they are consumed by stock, and converted
into dung; and Col. John Taylor,
(of Caroline county, Virginia) to whose
valuable labours the world is so much indebted,
is also of opinion, that we ought
not to rely on green vegetables only. In
the first edition of his <em>Arator</em>, he seemed
to think, that nothing more was necessary
than clover, but in the second edition, he
acknowledged his error, which had been
demonstrated by the result of two crops
of Indian corn. In 80 acres of land, improved
by turning in the grass, without
other manure, the crop averaged 25 bushels
an acre. But in 200 acres, where
the clover was turned in and the ground
also manured, the average was 50 bushels.
It is probable, indeed, that the ploughing
in of clover, may have a greater effect in
many parts of the United States, than in
England. For, that large crops of grain
have been produced by it, is so strongly attested,
that it must not be denied. This may
be owing to the Superior efficacy of the
gypsum, which, no doubt, acts more powerfully
here, than generally in England, and
therefore produces a greater quantity of
clover. But, as it is certain, that the manure
of dung, incorporated with putrefied
vegetable matter, is more efficacious than
simple green vegetables; what I intend, is
to exhort our farmers not to trust to the
latter alone, nor relax their efforts to collect
the former in as great quantities as
possible.</p>

<p>Another important circumstance is to
be attended to. We are not to expect,
that land will continue to produce luxuriant
crops of clover, for ever, even when
aided by gypsum.&mdash;It would be contrary
to the order of nature; which delights
in change. Our <em>second</em> crop of clover, has,
for many years, been of little value, though
the cause remains unexplained. A gentleman
of veracity, who lives on the Delaware,
between eight or ten miles above
the city, assured me, that gypsum, which
had done wonders for a long time, had
at length ceased to have any effect on
his land; and that the same was the case
of some of his neighbours. I am informed
also, that the same remark has been
made by farmers in Montgomery county.
Now it is not to be supposed, that the
gypsum has changed its nature, or lost
its virtue.&mdash;But the earth, being exhausted
of those particles which are favourable
to the growth of clover, no longer
offers to the gypsum the same matter to
act upon. That the matter, necessary for
the formation of a particular plant, may be
exhausted, while the same earth suffices
for the vigorous production of other plants,
is proved by daily experience; and is an
accordance with the best theory.</p>

<p>In a late English publication, there is an
offer of a considerable premium to the
person who shall discover a grass which
shall be a good substitute for clover, it being
understood that clover no longer grew
as formerly; and of another premium to
the person who shall discover the means
of restoring lands, which once bore clover,
to a capacity of producing it again.
It would, therefore, be wise in us, to look
out in time, for some grass, to take the
place of clover, when it shall be found
no longer to succeed. In the mean time,
we may avail ourselves (and it may perhaps
be a very long time) of the united
efficacy of gypsum and clover.</p>

<p>I said that we had much to do before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
we attained that degree of perfection
which was practicable in agriculture. I
presume, that our lands, in their natural
state, were full as good as those of England.
In England, the average crops of
grain of all kinds, on 8,000,000 of acres,
are estimated at twenty-four bushels the
acre. I take this estimate from Sir John
Sinclair, who says, moreover, that in "fertile
districts and propitious seasons, from
thirty-two to forty bushels of wheat an
acre, may be confidently expected; from
forty-two to fifty of barley, from fifty-two
to sixty-four of oats, and from twenty-eight
to thirty-two of beans." The best
county in Pennsylvania, is supposed to be
Lancaster. The matter cannot be spoken
of with any kind of certainty; but, from
the best information I have been able to
collect, I should doubt whether the <em>wheat</em>
crops of the whole county of Lancaster,
averaged more than fifteen bushels an acre,
though many individual farmers get from
twenty to thirty; and some from thirty
to forty. But, when we compare the agriculture
of two countries, we must take it
in large masses. Penn's Valley, in Pennsylvania,
is supposed to yield crops of
<em>wheat</em>, averaging at least twenty bushels
an acre; but that is owing to something
peculiar in the climate; for the crops do
not ripen in less than two weeks later
than in most other parts of the state. The
soil in Penn's valley, is limestone, and the
water lies very deep.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, however, that the
agriculture of Pennsylvania is steadily improving,
and is at present actually improved
as highly as that of any state in the union.
In buildings for agricultural purposes (perhaps
too expensive) she is unrivalled; so
that without being over sanguine, we may
promise ourselves an annual increase of
the value of our lands. How this progress
may be quickened, is a question which
this Society should keep constantly in
view.&mdash;To devise the means of acceleration,
should be their study.&mdash;To the first
great step towards general improvement,
the organization of societies in every part
of the state, we have one what was in our
power, by petitioning the legislature to
take the subject into consideration, and aid
the undertaking with necessary funds.
Nor is there any reason to doubt of success;
for the legislature is always liberal
when the general interest demands it. The
institution of county societies, with the distribution
of premiums, will be a powerful
stimulus to the dormant faculties of
thousands. The Eastern States, including
New York, have already made the experiment
with success; and I honour them
for the example. Our Society, being situated
in the capital, has the best means of
correspondence; so that we can reciprocate
information on agricultural subjects,
with the different societies throughout
this, and other states, and with countries
beyond the sea. Hence will be collected
a stock of knowledge, which being condensed,
and methodized, may be offered
to the public with great advantage.</p>

<p>A pattern farm is an object we have
long had at heart, and it is not to be relinquished.
But the time is not come,
for carrying our wishes into effect. At
present, we have not sufficient funds; and
to incur a debt, in our corporate capacity,
without the means of payment, would
justly dishonour us. But the want of a
pattern farm may be in some measure supplied,
by the exertions of members of the
society, who possess farms within a few
miles of the city. Some of them are blessed
with ample means, as well as inclination,
to give a fair trial to every improvement
which can be rationally suggested,
either in instruments of husbandry, the
application of manures, or the cultivation
of new plants, grains, or grasses.</p>

<p>We may render ourselves useful, by
collecting and diffusing the information
contained in books recently published in
Europe or America. In Europe the principal
nobility and gentry are paying due
honours to Agriculture. Chemistry has
been called to her aid, from which important
discoveries must result. Earths,
minerals, and manures of all kinds are analysed.
Philosophy is in the right path.
Facts are first ascertained, and then accounted
for. The increased power of magnifying
glasses, lays open the hidden parts
of plants, and minute animals. Hence may
be discovered the <em>causes</em>, and consequently
the <em>cure</em>, of many disorders by which
plants are infested. Already it is asserted,
(I vouch not for the truth of it) that
the disease in wheat called the <em>smut</em>, is
no other than a parasite plant, which adhering
to the seed-wheat, grows with it,
and may be destroyed by proper applications,
before the seed is sown. Perhaps
some fortunate observer may let us
into the nature of that scourge of Agriculture,
known by the name of the Hessian
fly, so that we may get rid of it, as we
did of the weevil fly, some forty years
ago. Such a man would deserve a statue
of gold, and I think the farmers would
gladly erect it.</p>

<p>Another point of duty, to which we
have not been wanting, is the importation
of such foreign grains, grasses, and plants,
as are suitable to our climate. Of all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
grains which now grow in the middle
states, I recollect none, but maize, (Indian
corn) which is native. Perhaps we have
not yet collected all which might be profitably
cultivated; and even if we have,
a change of seed is of great importance.
What wealth has flowed into the southern
states, from cotton, which, thirty years
ago, was scarce known there! Something
new is always turning up, and we
should be on the alert, to avail ourselves
of it.</p>

<p>The Society has heretofore given admonition
of the necessity of change in
seed-grain. I do not mean merely the
change of one grain for another of a different
kind, (as <em>wheat</em> for <em>rye</em>, &amp;c.) but
a change of seed, where there is no change
of kind. Farmers do not seem aware of
this necessity, nor of the great advantage
of procuring seed of the very best kind,
and cleaning it in the most perfect manner.
Or if they are aware, they are deterred
from paying attention to it, by a
little trouble and a little expense. It
would be well to keep the subject before
their eyes, until a conviction of its importance
shall produce an alteration of
practice.</p>

<p>The importation of foreign animals is
not to be neglected. It is not the business
of this Society, nor have they the
means of importing them;&mdash;but they may
point them out. We have, in Pennsylvania,
good horses; but in the best breeds
of cattle, hogs and sheep, we are defective.
I know that some enterprising gentlemen
in the city have gone to great expense
in importing cattle, and others are
in possession of excellent breeds of hogs,
but they are not yet diffused through the
state. It is understood, that in the Eastern
States, no pains or expense have been
spared, in procuring animals of the finest
shape and quality. But it may be some
time, before they have a surplus for exportation.</p>

<p>We are well situated for obtaining models
of all newly invented implements of
husbandry. Our workmen are ingenious,
and able to execute any thing which is
planned for them; and the genius of our
countrymen in the application of the mechanic
powers, is conspicuous. The high
price of labour, rendered its abridgement
of primary importance. What wonderful
effects have been produced by Whitney's
cotton gin? We are well supplied
with implements for breaking the earth,
and for cutting all kinds of straw, and
cheap machines for shelling Indian corn.
But a machine effectual for the threshing of
wheat, and not too high-priced, is a desideratum.
The machine for dressing flax,
of British invention, is said to be a very
great improvement, but is not yet much
in use among us.</p>

<p>Roads, bridges, canals, and all internal
public improvements, are subjects, which
though not within our control, have such
an immediate bearing on Agriculture, by
expediting and cheapening carriage, that
it will be always proper to do what little is
in our power, for their success. Works of
such magnitude are not to be executed,
without the combined exertions of many
persons, sanctioned by the authority of
the legislature, and assisted by the public
purse. Our legislature has done nobly
for roads and bridges, and we trust it will
do the same for canals. The first great
object of that kind, is the junction of the
waters of the Susquehanna and the Schuylkill,
which empties into the Delaware.
That being accomplished, we may look
westward to the waters of the Alleghany,
and northward to the Seneca lake,
which being once entered, and entered
it may be with no great difficulty, we
have the Delaware connected with the
great northern lakes, by means of the
magnificent work now in rapid progress,
in the state of New York. The project is
grand;&mdash;I may not live to see it executed,
yet it is by no means so improbable as
many things once appeared, which in my
time have been accomplished.</p>

<p>Yet, it must be confessed, that in canals,
we linger behind other states, who
have boldly led the way. Except the
works now carrying on, for the improvement
of the navigation on the Schuylkill
and the Lehigh, we have nothing to show
but the Conewago canal of a single mile,
which will be of little use, unless the Susquehanna
and Delaware are united. Our
tardiness may be accounted for. Five and
twenty years ago, when the Conewago
canal was begun, public spirit mounted
perhaps too high. Great efforts were
made, which, from causes not necessary
now to mention, proved abortive.&mdash;Hence,
a despondence on the subject of canals,
from which we have scarce yet recovered.
But it is high time to rouse ourselves. On
the one side we have New York making
great and successful exertions; on the
other, Maryland, endeavouring to avail
herself of the road, made at the expense
of the United States, from Cumberland, on
the Potowmac, to Wheeling, on the Ohio;
on which wagons travel free from toll.
But, if we can have water carriage from
Philadelphia to Susquehanna, we shall be
on a better footing than Baltimore; and
preserve our wagon carriage to Pittsburg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
until the Susquehanna shall be joined to
the Alleghany. This wagon carriage is
of immense importance. It has been supposed,
that between Philadelphia and
Pittsburg, the yearly sum paid for carriage,
amounted to 730,000 dollars. Nor is
this the only consideration. A very great
sum is expended all along the line of the
turnpike road, which is diffused through
the country to a considerable distance. A
six horse wagon consumes five bushels of
oats a day, besides hay. Now, it appears
from an official return, made by the keeper
of the turnpike gate, at the Chesnut
Ridge, between Stoys Town, and Greensburg,
that there passed through that
gate, during the year ending May, 1818;
among other things, 281 four-horse, 2412
five-horse, and 2698 six-horse teams; and
it is said, that a gentleman, living on the
road near Pittsburg, in the year 1813,
counted the number of wagons, laden with
merchandize, which passed his house that
year, and that they amounted to 4055.
Through the counties of Bedford and Somerset,
the road, being generally on ridges,
runs through a poor country, to which the
market afforded by the wagons, is essential.
Somerset abounds in <em>grass</em>; and for <em>oats</em>
is superior to any county in the state.&mdash;But
the soil is not favourable to wheat;
and, except in the southern part, Indian
corn will scarce arrive at maturity. It appears,
clearly, therefore, that the Agriculture
of Pennsylvania is very much interested,
even in parts far west of the Susquehanna,
in a water communication between
that river and the Delaware, as the
most effectual means of preserving the
land carriage to Pittsburg. Another
weighty consideration is, the protection
which ought to be afforded to Pittsburg,
against the effect of the United States'
turnpike from Cumberland to Wheeling.
Pittsburg ought to be to the western part
of the state, what Philadelphia is to the
eastern: the reservoir of wealth sufficient
to afford a market to the surrounding
country. There is no rivalship between
these cities. The prosperity of one promotes
the prosperity of the other. Why
then should we hesitate? New York has
completed 120 miles of canal in less than
two years and five months. By a line of
less than half that length, the Delaware
and Susquehanna are united.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania has been accused of want
of attention to gardening, and I am afraid
she must plead guilty to the charge. A
good kitchen garden contributes much to
the health, and even the elegance of life;
the saving of meat makes it a source of economy,
and the neatness which is necessary
to keep it in order, may have an effect on
the <em>manners</em> of the family. The females
might execute a good deal of the work,
and for their sake it should be interspersed
with flowers. I believe my feelings
are not at all singular, and I declare that I
am struck with a sensation of pleasure, at
the sight of a flourishing, well enclosed
garden. May I be allowed to add, that I
have the same feelings, at sight of a neat
inclosure in front of the dwelling house,
separating it from the highway. With surprise
and regret, I perceive this often neglected,
by wealthy and liberal farmers,
merely because they have been in the habit
of living without it. Such things might
be remedied at a very trifling expense, but
they are of no trifling consequence. They
have an influence on manners.</p>

<p>I say nothing on the subject of <em>hedges</em>,
their importance, and the best mode of
raising them have been fully shown by
one of our Vice Presidents, on a former
occasion.</p>

<p>The limits of this discourse confine me
to <em>hints</em>, on subjects which merit <em>treatises</em>.
May not means be taken to tincture the
youthful mind, with the spirit of Agriculture?
In <em>colleges</em>, natural philosophy and
chemistry might sometimes be directed to
that special purpose. But something may
be done at an <em>earlier age</em>; particularly
where opportunities are offered, in teaching
the learned languages, which being
acquired slowly and with difficulty, leave
lasting impressions; for instance, besides
the Georgics of Virgil, which are in general
use, select passages might be read
from Columella, one of the most ancient
writers on rural affairs, which have reached
us, in the Latin tongue. I am afraid
mischief is done, by putting into the
hands of boys, those finished models of
Grecian and Roman eloquence, in which
are painted, in too vivid colours, the pleasures
of wine, and love, and the glory of
war.</p>

<p>Having touched the subject of education,
I will add, that when the benevolent
intention of the constitution of Pennsylvania,
shall be carried into effect, by "<em>the
establishment of schools throughout the state,
in such manner, that the poor may be taught
gratis</em>," Agriculture will reap her full
share of the benefit. Reading, writing,
and common arithmetic, if not essential,
are very serviceable to the farmer. And
even the labourer will derive incalculable
advantage from the improvement of his
intellectual faculties. Work cannot be
continued without intermission, and time
hangs heavy on the mind which is torpid
during the hours of repose. Exercise is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
as necessary to the mind as the body.
How desirable then, that men should be
qualified for that kind of reading, which
gratifies and strengthens the mind, without
the fatigue of severe study, while the
body is at rest during the intervals of labour?
Our legislature is not unmindful
of the duty imposed by the constitution&mdash;the
act "to provide for the education of
children at the public expense within the
city and county of Philadelphia," is working
great good. By the first annual report
of the controllers of these schools,
made in February last, it appears that
2845 children were then in a course of
education; and I am informed that the
number is now much increased. Moreover,
a most important fact is established&mdash;that
by adopting the Lancasterian mode
of teaching, which will do in all thickly
settled districts, the annual expense will
not exceed <em>four dollars</em> for each child.
Upon efforts like these the blessing of
God may be confidently hoped for.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more effectual for the
diffusion of the spirit of Christianity, than
a moderate cultivation of the understanding.
Men will thus become more mild,
better content with the condition in which
Providence has placed them, more attentive
to their duties both moral and religious,
more charitable towards each other,
less jealous and vindictive in their feelings
towards foreign nations, less prone to rapine,
under whatever name disguised, and
less easily dazzled by the false splendour
of war.</p>

<p>But I must indulge myself on this topic
no longer, lest it seduce me from my
main design.</p>

<p>Closely connected with Agriculture is
the subject of leases. Though not so important
in the United States, as in other
countries, because the body of tenantry
is smaller here, yet it is not undeserving
of attention. The leases generally in use,
are for a short term, with a reservation, by
way of rent, of a certain share of the produce
of the land. This system is liable to
two great objections. The shortness of
the tenure, precludes all hope of improvement
of the soil, and the mode of payment,
(the rendering a share of the crop,)
holds out inducements to fraud, which
few tenants are able to resist. When the
landlord lives upon the estate, he has some
chance of checking the tenant, by obtaining
an accurate knowledge of the amount
of the crop; and if he is liberal, he may
have something done in the way of improvement.
But where he lives at a distance,
the probability is, that the estate
will go to ruin, while he receives but a
small part of his due. The objections to
long leases, for rents in money, are, that
if the landlord parts with the possession
for a long time, he may be injured by
a bad tenant; that he precludes himself
from the chance of a sale, if a good price
should be offered, and that the great fluctuations
in the price of grain, make it impossible
to fix a rent in money, without
danger to both parties. Where a man has
it in view to sell his estate, he may be
right, in making a short lease; that case
forms an exception to the general rule.
But where he means to keep it, the objection
is removed; then, as to fluctuation
of price, the matter might be easily managed,
by reserving a rent of a certain
quantity of grain, giving the tenant an
election to pay the market price, in money,
which might be more convenient than
delivering the grain. That point being
settled, a lease for a longer term, fixing
the rotation in which the fields should be
cultivated, with other proper covenants,
would leave the landlord sufficiently protected,
while it gave the tenant encouragement
to meliorate the soil for his own
interest. At the end of such a lease, the
value of the estate would be increased,
and the rent might be raised. With great
deference I submit these remarks to gentlemen
of the city, who have farms at
some distance, or even in the neighbourhood,
which are intended as a provision for
their families.</p>

<p>One thing more remains, which I cannot
in conscience pass by, and in which, perhaps
the Society may find means to do
some good. Can no method be devised,
to check the inordinate use of spirituous
liquors? This shocking habit, strikes at
the root of agriculture, by robbing it of
the labour necessary for its support. It
would be a waste of time, to enumerate
the ills which flow from this disgraceful
vice, because they are obvious to everyone.
Perhaps a small addition to the
wages, would induce labourers to forego
the use of this poisonous liquid; or they
might consent to take as a substitute, beer,
or cider, or some other harmless drink.
The subject deserves the deepest consideration,
and I cannot help hoping, that
when societies shall be organized in the
several counties, a plan may be formed,
which being acted upon at once, throughout
the state, may greatly lessen, if not
eradicate the evil.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured, gentlemen, to obey
your commands, in hopes that my example
may call forth the efforts of others,
better qualified to do justice to the subject.</p>

<h2><a name="Law_Case" id="Law_Case"><em>Law Case.</em></a></h2>

<p>The following opinion delivered by
JACOB RUSH, President of the Court of
Common Pleas of the City and County of
Philadelphia, will be found particularly
interesting by persons residing in the
Country, and who may be exposed to controversies
about line fences, and their repairs.
The examination of the provisions
of the act of Assembly, and of the
principles of law on the points involved
in the case will be interesting and useful
to every Lawyer.</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Law Case">
  <tr>
    <td class="tdc">Overseers of the Poor of Byberry,<br /><em>vs.</em><br />F.I.</td>
    <td class="tdc bl">Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Certiorari.</td>
  </tr>
</table></div>

<p>A Certiorari issued out of this
Court, directed to Joshua Jones and
Elisha Gordon, Esquires, requiring
them to transmit certain proceedings
had before them under the fence law
of 1700, in which John T. Townshend
and Israel Walton, Overseers
of the poor of Byberry are the complainants,
and F. I. the defendant.</p>

<p>Prior to stating the facts on the
return, it will be proper to give a
brief exposition of the very obscure
law upon which the controversy has
arisen.</p>

<p>The act of 1700, for the regulation
of fences, gives authority to fence
viewers in two cases.&mdash;1st. Where a
person finding a fence actually erected,
takes advantage of such existing
fence, and makes it a part of a subsequent
enclosure. The person making
such subsequent enclosure, and
deriving a benefit from his neighbours
fence, is bound to pay one half
the expense of such fence. He is
equally bound afterwards himself to
keep in repair one half of it, or to
pay the expense of repairing it.&mdash;Which
leads to the 2d. point, and
this consists in the power the fence
viewers have over fences, either erected
or subsequently divided, by agreement
between two neighbours. The
fence viewers cannot compel a person
to join fences with his neighbour,
every man having an undoubted right
to erect a fence upon his own ground.
The authority of the viewers is derived
from the consent of the parties
expressed or implied. In the case of
a person deriving a benefit from making
a fence actually existing, a part
of the enclosure around his own field,
he virtually agrees by his conduct, to
make compensation.&mdash;In the 2d. case,
viz: repairing fences, the parties are
supposed to have joined originally in
erecting the fence, or by some subsequent
contract, to have come under
an engagement to keep in repair a
moity of the fence.</p>

<p>The viewers being only judges of the
value, or of the sufficiency of fences,
cannot order a <em>new</em> fence to be erected.
In the former case, that is, the
value, they are to award compensation;
in the latter, they are to direct
the party delinquent to repair the
fence, and in case of his neglecting it
for ten days, then upon application
and proof thereof before two Justices,
they are to order the <em>persons
aggrieved</em> to repair the fence, who
shall be reimbursed by the party refusing
to repair the fence. When
the party <em>aggrieved</em>, has repaired the
the fence, in obedience to the order
of the two justices, the fence viewers,
who by the law are the <em>sole judges</em>
of the charge to be borne by the
delinquent, must be called upon to
fix the amount of compensation, to
be reimbursed by the delinquent, for
which sum, together with costs, the
justices are required to issue a warrant
against him to be levied upon his
goods and chattels.</p>

<p>If the viewers and the two justices
have in all respects conformed
to the law, and have kept <em>within</em> their
jurisdiction, the facts cannot <em>now</em> be
controverted. What are the facts in
this case?</p>

<p>The viewers have been legally
summoned to view and examine a
fence which separates the lands of
the complainant's from the land of
the defendants. They say they were
called to view a <em>partition fence</em> be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>tween
the said parties, and that on
such examination, they found the defendant's
part to be deficient, or not
lawful, and that they directed him to
make a good and sufficient fence <em>on
the line</em> within ten days. This order
of the viewers is dated 21st January,
1815.</p>

<p>The defendants having neglected
to repair the fence for <em>more</em> than ten
days, the complainants did according
to law, apply to two justices for an
order to be issued to him to repair
the fence, which order, the said justices,
after being satisfied by due
proof, that the defendant had neglected
to repair the fence, for ten days, did
issue on the 26th August, 1815.&mdash;To
this order the complainants have
returned to the justices that they
have complied therewith and repaired
the fence.</p>

<p>As far as the proceedings have
gone, every thing has been done
agreeable to the law.</p>

<p>Four exceptions however have been
filed by the defendant. The first and
second objections may be comprised
in one, and present a difficulty of a
legal nature, that the complainants
represent a corporate body, and are
therefore not included in the law
that relates to fences.&mdash;If this objection
were well founded, its operation
would be conclusive in favour of the
defendant, because a law that does
not bind both parties in interest, never
ought to be carried into execution
against <em>either</em>.&mdash;In our opinion,
however, the law in the case before
us includes <em>corporate bodies</em>, as well
as natural persons. The statute 22.
H. 8. ch. 5. for the repair of bridges
which subjects to taxation, the <em>inhabitants</em>
of every Shire, Riding, City,
or Town, and for non-payment of
which their goods may be seized and
sold, has been universally acknowledged
and held to include <em>Corporations</em>.
2 inst. 703. comp. 79. Sir T.
Jones 167.</p>

<p>The word <em>Inhabitants</em>, says Sir Edward
Coke, is the largest word of the
kind, and includes every corporation
or Body Politic, residing in any County,
Riding, City or Town. To these
authorities we shall only add, that in
2 Bac. Abr. Wilson's Edition, page
10, it is expressly laid down, that
<em>Corporations</em> in the character of
<em>owners</em> or <em>occupiers</em> of houses or
lands, are subject to the same burden
to which <em>individuals</em> are subject, in
the same character.</p>

<p>The good sense of these decisions,
must strike every body, as their tendency
is to place natural and artificial
bodies on the same footing.</p>

<p>The third exception filed by the
defendant, viz: that the two justices
ordered the complainants to put up
the fence, <em>without</em> requiring proof
that the defendant had <em>not</em> complied
with the order of the viewers, is destitute
of foundation. The record of
the justices show that this exception
is founded in mistake.</p>

<p>The fourth exception is, that the
viewers had no authority to order the
defendant to put up and repair his
fence <em>on the line</em>.</p>

<p>It is certain they could not order
him to put it up or repair it <em>off the
line</em>; and having directed him to repair
it <em>on the line</em>, cannot invalidate
the order. Viewing the words, <em>on
the line</em>, in the most exceptionable
light, they can be deemed nothing
but surplusage. The substantial drift
of the order is, that the defendant
shall repair the fence.</p>

<p>With respect to the affidavit of
the defendant of the 6th of January,
1816, that he has enclosed completely
the burial ground on his <em>own</em> ground,
leaving an interval of 10 feet between
the line of the burial ground and the
fence he has put up, the Court would
remark, that generally speaking, a
man has a right to put up a fence
upon his own land, and as many as he
pleases. A man must however so
exercise his right, as not to injure
those of another. Having once joined
fences with his neighbours he cannot,
when ordered to repair his share<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
of it, evade the law, by removing it,
and placing it altogether upon his
<em>own</em> ground. Where the law has
once laid its hands upon a man, he
must not be allowed to escape from
its operation. Nothing can meet the
approbation of a Court, that would
look like an evasion of the law. A
man cannot in one and the same
breath, say he is bound and not
bound. Whether a person might remove
his share of a <em>division fence</em>
and place it upon his <em>own</em> ground,
prior to an inspection by the fence
viewers, is a point not now before the
Court. But we are very clearly of
opinion, removing a fence <em>after</em> it had
been repaired in obedience to the order
of two Justices, cannot exempt
him from the operation of the law.</p>

<p>There being no error in point of
law in the proceedings removed, the
judgment of the Court is, they must
be confirmed.</p>

<h2><a name="MISCELLANY" id="MISCELLANY">MISCELLANY.</a></h2>


<p><em>Modes of salutation.</em>&mdash;From the
form of salutations among different
nations we may learn something of
their character, at least of their manners.
In the southern provinces of
China the common people ask "Ya
Tan," that is, How have you eaten
your rice; for in that is their greatest
felicity. If two Dutchmen meet
in the morning they wish each other
good appetite. "Smaakelyk leten."
In Cairo the inhabitants ask how do
you sweat? for the not sweating
is the symptom of an approaching
fever. The Italian and Spaniard
ask How does it stand? "Come
sta." The Frenchman, How do you
carry yourself? "Comment vous
portez vous?" The German, How
do you find yourself? "Wie befinden
sie sich." The English, "How
do you do?" The Dutchman says,
How fare you. "Hau vaart uwe."
There is one nation (we forget
which) which ask "How do you
live," and these are certainly the
most wise of all.</p>

<p><em>To make starch.</em>&mdash;To make starch
from wheat, the grain is steeped in
cold water until it becomes soft and
yields a milky juice by pressure; it
is then put into sacks of linen, and
pressed in a vat filled with cold water;
as long as any milky juice
exudes, the pressure is continued;
the fluid gradually becomes clear,
and a white powder subsides, which
is starch.</p>

<p><em>Chestnut wood</em> has recently been
successfully applied to the purpose
of dyeing and tanning, thus forming
a substitute for log-wood, and oak
bark. Leather tanned by it, is declared
by the gentleman who made
the experiments, to be superior to
that tanned with oak bark; and in
dyeing, its affinity for wool is said, on
the same authority, to be greater than
that of either galls or sumac, and
consequently the colour given more
permanent. It also makes admirable
ink.</p>

<p><em>The ants of Valencia.</em>&mdash;M. Humboldt
informs, that ants abound to
such a degree near Valencia, that
their excavations resemble subterraneous
canals, which are filled with
water in the time of the rains, and
become very dangerous to the buildings.</p>

<p>Mr. Heathfield has published a
pamphlet, in England, proposing to
pay off one half of the national debt,
by an assessment of 15 per cent. on
the capital of all property in the
kingdom. The Courier says the project
"is wise, necessary, and will be
effectual," and permit the repeal of
twenty millions of taxes.</p>

<p><em>Longitude.</em>&mdash;La Baronne De Paris
Boisrowvray, has arrived in England
from Paris, charged with a commission
to present to the Admiralty
Board, a theory of the compass, which
gives the longitude and latitude of
the globe, for the discovery of which
the whole world has so long looked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
The husband of this lady has submitted
his theory to the Academy at
Paris. His wife's mission to London
was to prevent delay, as well as to
have a trustworthy agent.</p>

<p><em>Indian Jurisprudence.</em>&mdash;The Cherokees,
it is said, have established
something like a judiciary system,
and introduced into their society
many of the laws and usages of civilization.
Some of their savage institutions
are disappearing, under the
ameliorating influence of moral justice.
As a specimen of the manner
in which they dispense justice in
cases of trivial import, we relate the
following anecdote, said to be authentic:</p>

<p>An Indian assaulted another, of
which regular information was made.
The judge ordered the sheriff to
bring the parties before him. The
sheriff went in pursuit of them, but
returned without them. "Where
are your prisoners?" said the judge.
"I caught them," replied the sheriff,&mdash;"What
did you do with them?" "I
gave the defendant fifteen lashes."
"What did you do with the plaintiff?"
"Gave him fifteen too." "What with
the informer or witness?" "Why I
gave him twenty-five lashes&mdash;for, had
he held his tongue, there would have
been none of this fuss and trouble."
It would be well if all the dispensations
of justice could be so equally
and promptly administered.</p>

<p><em>Preservation of Water at Sea.</em>&mdash;M.
Pernet, after an examination of
the means which are, or may be
adopted for the preservation of fresh
water at sea, gives the preference to
the following: 1½ parts of oxide of
manganese in powder is mixed with
250 parts of water, and agitated
every fifteen days. In this way water
has been preserved unchanged for
seven years.</p>

<p>The editor of the Annales de Chimie
observes, that oxide of manganese
has the power, not only of preserving
water, but of rendering that
sweet which has become putrid; but
he also points out the important circumstance,
that the oxide is slightly
soluble in water, and therefore recommends
the use of iron tanks for
the water, as in England.</p>

<p><em>A species of limestone</em> has been discovered
in working the canal through
the state of New York, and since in
many parts of the country, so well
adapted for water cement as to supercede
the necessity of importing,
as heretofore done, at great expense
the principal ingredient of hydraulic
mortar.</p>

<p><em>Charleston, January 27.</em>&mdash;We have

<p><span class="smcap">Remarks.</span>&mdash;It must be highly gratifying
to the benevolent mind, and to those
whose humane labours have been so long
directed to mitigate the ravages of Small
Pox, to learn, that there has not been a single
case of death, by that disease, reported
in this city within the last year&mdash;a disease
which has been, for so many ages, a
scourge to every part of the world; and
has, at times, been particularly fatal here.</p>

<p>Whilst Consumption and Fever, generally,
occupy a considerable space in the annual
returns, it is consolatory to observe,
that the former has not increased: and
that Fever, particularly Typhus, so fatal,
so wide spread, and so unyielding to medical
skill in Europe, has been much less
malignant in this city the present, than in
former years.</p>

<span class="i0">Now haunts old hollow'd oaks, deserted cells,<br /></span>

<h3>MOONLIGHT AND CALM AT SEA.</h3>

<div class="poetry-center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When every breeze is hush'd to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the soft zephyr of the dappled west<br /></span>
<span class="i16">Its voice does lose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Dian's silver light does sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the smooth bosom of the deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i16">How sweet to muse!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When ocean's swelling bosom bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems studded o'er with golden light,<br /></span>
<span class="i16">Of many a star;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wild sea fowls' harsh shrill strain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Echoing along th' unruffled main<br /></span>
<span class="i16">Is heard afar;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tis then each rising care does sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the soft stillness of the deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i16">In sympathetic power.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis then each swelling pulse does thrill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweetest bliss the heart does fill,<br /></span>
<span class="i16">In such an hour.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The soul too fond is soothed to rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By mild serenity possess'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i16">Nor thinks the storm is nigh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soon the placid scene is o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swelling ocean round does roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i16">Contesting with the sky.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tis thus on life's deceitful tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With placid course we seem to glide,<br /></span>
<span class="i16">All free from care;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soon the too delusive charm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flies fast away with every calm,<br /></span>
<span class="i16">And prospect fair!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then happy they, who list'ning hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voice that speaks the tempest near.<br /></span>
<span class="i16">And arms for every ill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whirlwind blast is then disarmed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of many a shaft that would have harm'd<br /></span>
<span class="i16">And half the storm is still.<br /></span>

<span class="i6">Go, idle lays!<br /></span>

<span class="i6">Tell her whose cheek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blush of conscious pleasure wears,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">That they who seek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find delights unmix'd with cares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall own the fond deceit in tears.<br /></span>

<span class="i6">The bosom warms,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The partial hand of Beauty gave,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">That from the worm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kind Pity's touch shall never save<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The charms that moulder in the grave!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Go, idle lays!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell her whose youthful heart beats high<br /></span>
<span class="i6">To future days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That now so fair in prospect lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How soon our dearest transports die!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Then softly say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, when terrestrial joys and pains<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Shall melt away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soul, absolv'd from sensual stains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall soar where bliss immortal re'gns!<br /></span>

<p>Mrs. Morris, the lady of major
Morris, who lately descended in the
diving-bell, at Plymouth, whilst under
water, wrote a long letter to her
father, which concluded with the following

<p>Of the few essays refused admittance in

necessity we apprehend ourselves under
of declining to insert the one on Politics
by Lucius. The ability with which it was
written, was not sufficient to overcome
our objection to the subject.&mdash;We invite
him heartily, as we have heretofore personally
done, to our <em>Evening Fire Side</em>,
